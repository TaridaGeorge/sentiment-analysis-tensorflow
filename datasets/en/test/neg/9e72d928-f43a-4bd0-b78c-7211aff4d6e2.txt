This clinic is owned by a different business that dictates the way they run their practice and the treatment recommendations they make. You'll never get good news from any of the doctors, and generally if your pet could have a very severe ailment or a mild one they will always lean toward the worst and generally recommend invasive procedures without testing for potential different causes. Furthermore, coming from someone who has spent thousands with them in the past year alone they will do everything in their power to be a hindrance on saving you any money by refusing to fax your animals prescriptions to any online pharmacy, which in turn forces you pay far more than necessary for prescriptions.
