Unless you like hanging out a Frat House, this place is not for you. There were fights in the hallway, drunk people yelling all night long, doors slamming starting at 10:00 pm until 3:00-4:00 am. We complained to the management only for them to shrug their shoulders as if to say, yes we hear this all of the time. The "maid" service does not even begin to clean your room until 5:00 pm, so we could not even get into our room to get ready for dinner.  Unless you are age 18-21, this is not the hotel for you. The Firesky Hotel, Sanctuary Resort even the Hilton hotel in Scottsdale are far better.
