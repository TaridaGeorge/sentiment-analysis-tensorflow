Horrible customer service!! I consider myself a patient person, but when there are three staff members, and the only people in the store are myself and a friend, I would at least appreciate a "hello" as I walk in the door. They didn't even look at us, and we waited for 15 minutes without a word from them. I wish I could write them a good review, I really do, but this is a place with terrible service. Horrible experience, and their prices were overpriced. DO NOT GO HERE!
