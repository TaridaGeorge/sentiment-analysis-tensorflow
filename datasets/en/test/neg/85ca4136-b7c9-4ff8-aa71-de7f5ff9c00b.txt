We had not been here for a couple of years. The food used to be great. Not anymore. Bad service. Horrible food. When we complained to the manager that the egg rolls were cold, his response was yeah right they were made in the 1st batch earlier on. Well how about the food. Same response. The place was in shambles as well.
