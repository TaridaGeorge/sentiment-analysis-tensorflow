Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well, if you're into that, you'll love this joint!!!

The food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage, which at any other place is a very small pizza, and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).  

Don't be fooled by this "gourmet" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.

when I compare this to say Oreganos, they are not even in the same ball league.

skip this joint....and save your money.
