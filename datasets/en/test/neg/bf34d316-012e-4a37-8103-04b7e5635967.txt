How can you mess up a franchise? This Sonic will show you how!  I live within walking distance and have been there way too many times out of sheer laziness and every time I get what I deserve for stupidly going back.  You have about a 10% chance of the stoned teen on guard (they're rotated out weekly it seems) getting your order right and then you get to spend 10 minutes trying to correct it with them and another 10 with the disgruntled manager dragged over after much head scratching.  Honestly out of the two dozen times I've been there they got my order right once, i actually went home, did a little dance and bought a lottery ticket that night.
