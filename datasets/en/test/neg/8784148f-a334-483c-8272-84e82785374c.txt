not great service. i walked in with an appointment i had scheduled 2 weeks before for a certain stylist because i had a special event the next day. Apparently when i called the weeks before the receptionist didn't care to put me under the stylists name i wanted so while i was told by the manager that "this happens all the time" i was not very happy to start my day. other than that the lady seemed nice but it wasn't the haircut i wanted which is the whole reason i scheduled before. This sort of thing has happened numerous times. i no longer go there and neither do any of my friends. its pretty ridiculous the manager can just shrug something like this off and think its okay.
