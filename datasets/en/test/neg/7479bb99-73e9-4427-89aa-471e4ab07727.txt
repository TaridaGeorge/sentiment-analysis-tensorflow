Dog Park? Who are they kidding?! This place was crap, and full of crap.. It looks as though people went in to this park just so their dogs could poop. There were no clean up mitts and it was small and stinky.

Whoever designed this dog park should be kicked in the balls. No grass, all gravel and the one water spigot? That's right -  outside of the park. Brainiack. I wish I would have yelped this before I went. What a waste.
