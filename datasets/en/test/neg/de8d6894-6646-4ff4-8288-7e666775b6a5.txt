Went here for lunch yesterday with a party of 10.  All of us were disappointed.  Three of us shared a ravioli dish, it was cold.  Other dishes were scalding hot.  We were never offered grated cheese.  When we were finished eating the waitress showed up to ask how everything WAS...when we told her about the cold food and cheese she couldn't have cared less.  They do add 18 percent tip which she mentioned as she dropped the check on the table.
