EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH SMALL BUSINESS can be found right here at the UPS Store near Donson Ranch. From the second you walk in, you'll hear conservative talk radio being played nice and loudly. Then when it's time to pay, better get out a second mortgage. This place over chargers for everything - EVERYTHING. I even asked for a paper clip after making $9.00 worth of photocopies and was told I had to buy a box. This UPS store is a BUST.
