I really liked this place when I was stopping into Phoenix, but will go in there  no longer. The food and the decor are good (and very complementary), but I can't get away from the rape-y way an off-duty bartender made me feel.
I am not gay, nor do I feel any animosity toward people with any differing sexualities. But, when I say no to a dude (I'm VERY hetero), I MEAN no. And when I know the guy works there and the rest of the staff leaves me there alone with him in an aggressive state, I feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable.
Nice food, nice booze. nice service. But the trust is lost. I am afraid to ever come back again without some sort of back-up.
