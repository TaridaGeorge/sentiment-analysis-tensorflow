WRINKLED

All i really want from a dry cleaners is a properly pressed shirt bc I firmly think ironing is a very tedious task.  They buy machines to make this very efficient and that's why we would pay $2 for one shirt.  So when the shirt comes back wrinkled, they are wasting my money AND time.  I really hate feeling cheated.

Please use this dry cleaners if you enjoy wasting your time.

Admittedly, I am in fact angry .. . .
