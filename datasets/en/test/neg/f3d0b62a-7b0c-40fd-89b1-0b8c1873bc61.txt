I really wish I had a moment to actually look at the furniture instead of being chased around the store and playing 20 questions with the most obnoxious saleswoman. She was blabbing about American made, keeping jobs in America, etc. I don't really care if the furnishings are made in the US or Bangladesh. If I like it I'll buy it. Anyway, this annoyed her that we weren't going for the "American made" pitch so she got really loud and yelled at us about not supporting America. Whatever lady.
