If you know what you need and don't expect any expertise or service then by all means go for it. 
We have spent thousands of dollars here at best buy and hundreds of it on their extended service plans but the geek squad is a joke, these guys don't know what they are doing and try to turn their errors into yours...Oh and if something is wrong be sure to plan on DOUBLE the amount of time to even have someone look at your equipment that knows what they are doing...Good luck.
