Seriously the worst breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. My bacon was cold and hard, the eggs were luke warm and made from powder sitting in a pile of water, the toast was soggy because it was sitting in the water from the eggs. They don't carry real butter only margarine and everything is cooked in a microwave(we noticed this on the way out). Disgusting! Not a restaurant! Not real food! Just gross!
