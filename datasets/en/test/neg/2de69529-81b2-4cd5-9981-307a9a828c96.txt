Do not trust this dealer. Originally I agreed to a $500 deposit on the vehicle I was interested in. When I found out that the dealer was building-in a bunch of extra costs in to the MSRP, I found a better deal. When I told Johnny Medrano that our deal was off, he tied-up $1000 in my account. Zero class, zero professionalism, not to be trusted.
