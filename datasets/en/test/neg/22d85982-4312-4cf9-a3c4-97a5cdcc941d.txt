Sophie B. nailed this one on the head.

I came here long after hearing how great it was, after many drives past the swanky slick exterior & logo, and...

WTF? I ordered something that had chicken. It was so crap, I can't remember what the name was. A heaping mound of exotic, square-cut iceberg lettuce served as pallbearer to cuts of perfectly overdone chicken. There may have been a grain of salt or whisper of an herb at some stage; I can't recall. Overall, a marriage of supreme disappointment. 

My lunch buddy had something just as memorable. And just as overpriced for what it was.

ATTENTION RESTAURANTEURS:  If I can make it better at home, then I'm staying home!
