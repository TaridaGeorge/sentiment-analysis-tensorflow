I've stopped in 2 or 3 times now and I have yet to interact with any of the sales people. Every time I've been in there, I've been completely ignored. The last time I went in, I waited by the register to ask a question about signing up for a class, and the women were too busy gossiping with another customer/friend to even acknowledge me.

They have a decent selection and their prices are average. But their customer service is non-existent. I won't be returning.
