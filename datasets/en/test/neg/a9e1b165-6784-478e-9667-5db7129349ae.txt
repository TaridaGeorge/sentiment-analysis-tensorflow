Hmmm, after my experience yesterday, I am really puzzled as to why this restaurant has received such great reviews.   My salad (a  Southwestern salad) was lacking key ingredients: lacking avocado, black beans, and cilantro.  The chicken was overdone, and the greens were old and wilted.  And the service was absolutely atrocious: no courtesy, no greeting, no smile, no nothing.
