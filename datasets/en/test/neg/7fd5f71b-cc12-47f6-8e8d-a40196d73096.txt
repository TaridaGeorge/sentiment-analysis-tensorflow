Ok this place is HIGHLY OVER RATED! I really would pass. The food was mediocre are best, slightly cold when served. Asking for refills on coffee or ice tea was like waiting for Congressional Approval... 

The menu looks enticing overall, even gives one hope, but seems to fall desperately short of combining what promises to be really good combination of flavors. 

Unfortunately the service was just as abysmal. Nice people, sweet, like molasses's about the same speed.

There are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area.  Don't stop, keep on driving or go to Einstein Bagels next door. You will be much happier.
