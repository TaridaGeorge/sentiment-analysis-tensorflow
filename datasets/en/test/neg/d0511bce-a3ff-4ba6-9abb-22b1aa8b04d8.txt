The staff is very rude.  We went in their for the free breakfast and it took over 30 minutes just for us to get a drink.  You cannot get the breakfast until after you get a drink.  When we complained to the owner we were told to leave.  We did not even yell we just told him the waitresses were slow.   It is dark and stinky and service sucks.  Will not ever go back.
