ive never waited for more than 20 mins at a fast food burger place. i kept telling my wife that it was a good sign and that it just means that the food will be super fresh. not so much. the fries were prob reheated at least twice as they looked old and the burger meat was on the cold side as well. ill just stick to freddys or in-n-out!!
