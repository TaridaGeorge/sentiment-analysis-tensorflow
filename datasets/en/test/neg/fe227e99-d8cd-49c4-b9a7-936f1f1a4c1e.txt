The worst dining experience I have ever had. The frozen margarita had large chunks of ice. We had to ask twice for the appetizer and our entrees when delivered an hour later were inedible. We have Groupons and Livingsocial which we will let lapse because you couldn't pay me to eat there again. This form requires I give at least one star; however my true rating would be zero.
