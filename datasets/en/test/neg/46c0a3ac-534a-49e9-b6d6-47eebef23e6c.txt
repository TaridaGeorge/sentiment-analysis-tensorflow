Really this place was gross.  They need to just scrub the place down.  It is filthy.  I was excited to find a cute little malt shop to take the kids to with a 5o's theme.  I had a Reuben.  The meat was tough, and could not be eaten.  My husband and son had a preformed patty for a burger.    My daughter  had a BLT.  Really?  How can you make a GROSS BLT!  It just made me sick that we spent $50 dollars on such a truly bad meal.  The malts were good.  It took us getting through 3/4 of our meal before they came though.  The wait staff was two college age girls that you could tell didn't give a rip if the customer was getting good service.  Go there for a malt or shake and call it good.  Everything else sucked.
