I was excited to try this place as I have heard of conveyor belt sushi and it sounded fun. I never realized it meant the same sushi going around and around and around again....as in getting old or cold if supposed to be hot (like the baked mussels). If you truly love sushi for the fish, skip this place. You get what you pay for, and at about $3/roll, that's what you get-most roll options were of the mayonnaise variety or tempura and the tempura wasn't good. The rice wasn't fresh either and I kept wondering if the rolls were a day old already. Too bad.
