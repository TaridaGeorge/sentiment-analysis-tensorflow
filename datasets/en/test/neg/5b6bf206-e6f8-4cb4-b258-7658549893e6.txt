I went to this place after reading the reviews on Yelp, but I was very disappointed.  I ordered some pulled port and sausage with some various sides.  The sausage tasted like a hotdog!!! I took it back to the counter thinking they accidentally gave me a hotdog happy meal or something...
 
The pulled pork was average and the collard greens were good, but for 20.28 for one meal, that's just wrong.  Maybe I'm being too critical, but I threw away a little more than half of the food I was served... I've lived in Texas and Georgia and know what good BBQ tastes like, but I wouldn't recommend this at all.
