I don't get it, I don't get it at all.  The hype over this place leaves me scratching my head.  The first time I went here, I thought the kids who worked there were super rude, and the sandwich was no better than a subway.  I decided to give this place a second try today.  My mistake.  The sandwich had zero taste, the bread was super dry, and the kid at the front was more interested in drinking his soda and going on break, than waiting on me. I wouldn't waste a dime or another minute on this place.
