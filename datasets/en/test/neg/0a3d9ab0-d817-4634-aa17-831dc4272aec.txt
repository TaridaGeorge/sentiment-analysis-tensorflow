Very unimpressed with Party Planet all the way around. We ordered two balloon arches for our school promotion ceremonies and they failed to deliver one of them. It was due to arrive at 8AM and they argued with us about the delivery time being 8:30AM when we called. They called to tell us they were on the way to our school to deliver it and then never showed up so we didn't have an arch for our morning ceremony. I am sure that the only reason we got our second arch was because of our angry phone calls about the first one being a reminder that they had to bring the 2nd by the afternoon. 

Very unimpressed and will not be using them again in the future.
