What a let down! After reading the great reviews I was excited to try this place out - I found the food, service, and atmosphere to be below average. Stood at the hostess stand for 5 minutes with no greeting, almost walked out, bad first impression. My spicy tuna roll was decent but the crab roll was 1/2 mayo and 1/2 crab. The waitress was sweet but never checked up on us after she delivered our food. When we were done she came over and looked down at my uneaten roll, I made a comment about it tasting like pure mayo and she just said 'sorry', no offer to replace it or take it off my bill. The fish did not taste fresh, uncaring service, and it took almost 2 hours from start to finish for a few rolls and apps, won't be returning.
