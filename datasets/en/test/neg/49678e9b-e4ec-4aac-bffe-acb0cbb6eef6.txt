My wife and I went to the Westgate New Year's Eve celebration last night only to be extremely disappointed.  Entry into the outdoor area was $20 or $10 if bought in advance, then every bar charged an additional $25-$50 cover charge.  The drink prices were about what we expected, but selection at the bars outside was extremely limited.  The band, Metalhead was less than average.  They reminded me of some garage bands I heard back in the day.  The "countdown" to midnight started 5 mins early, then it stopped and restarted again.  Less than climatic to say the least.  Needless to say, we will not return next year and recommend if you are thinking about going to this you should reconsider.
