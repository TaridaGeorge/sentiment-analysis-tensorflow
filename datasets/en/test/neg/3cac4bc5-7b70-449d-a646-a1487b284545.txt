Very inconsistent. 

We were excited to fly with Alaska, but first thing when we got to Phoenix's Alaska Airlines, we were so disappointed. 

The woman working there was not friendly, helpful, or welcoming. She charged us EXTRA for our baggage, when no one else has been charging us - AT ALL!!! EVEN WHEN WE FLEW ALASKA AGAIN, THE MAN IN SEATTLE didn't charge us at all! 

THIS WOMAN charged us $50 for extra baggage. Our luggage wasn't even heavy! PLUS, I have my military I.D. and we were flying FIRST CLASS. 

She didn't even ask or give us a second to figure something out. I DO NOT LIKE THIS BRANCH OF ALASKA AIRLINES in PHOENIX. 

TOTAL FAIL.
