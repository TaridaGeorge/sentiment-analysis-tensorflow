Very loud clubs all around it.  If you are going to be downtown clubbing all night than this hotel would be great, but if you want to sleep at night don't come here.  The clubs are really loud, especially between midnight and 3am.  The AC is so loud you can't hear yourself think, although it does cover over the loud clubs.  The facilities are fine though they are kind of back in an alley and not as new and nice as advertised.
