Hot chicks and stiff drinks. An outside bar where you can smoke. What could be bad about this? 

The service sucks. 

For the second time in 3 weeks I went in with a buddy and could not get anyone to serve us. We flagged one one of the many waitresses and asked for a menu. We never were asked for an order. For the 2 beers we did get we had to go to the bar and get them our selves. 

Sunday morning I talked to a friend who had been in Wednesday night and got the same type of treatment. This place does not deserve your business, especially at $6. a pint.
