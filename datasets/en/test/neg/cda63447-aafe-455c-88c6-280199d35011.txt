very bad service. Felt like I was a bother to the guys in the shop.  When I requested something that they said had to be ordered in special, for weeks they told me that it was still on order and would call when it arrived...never a call.  Went to a different shop that get the part and installed it within a week.  These guys are real snobs and make you feel like they are doing you a favor if they talk to you...too busy yacking it up with their team riders.  Go somewhere else that believes in customer service, or at least understands what it is....
