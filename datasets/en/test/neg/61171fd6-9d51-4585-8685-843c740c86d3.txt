I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs.
