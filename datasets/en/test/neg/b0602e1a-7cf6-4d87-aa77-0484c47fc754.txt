Worst place I have ever been! First of all they say if you get an oil change you get a free wash but the oil change costs 46 dollars but ok I did it anyways. My car was NOT clean at all. My windows are all still dirty and the inside was not wiped down I wish I could post the pictures of how bad it was. DON'T waste your money! I wouldn't even give it a one star if I didn't have to.
