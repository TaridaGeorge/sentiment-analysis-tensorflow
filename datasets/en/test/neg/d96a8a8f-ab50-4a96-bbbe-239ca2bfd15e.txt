What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say "Thank you US Airwarys" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!
