i find this store creepy. it seems like the perfect place to witness the absolute worst side of human behavior (after violent riots and genocide, I mean). Any store that has a disclaimer sign out front, sternly warning customers not to run, shove, or steal from each other's carts, gets struck off my regular shopping list. You'd think those rules are just common decency, but apparently not at Last Chance.
