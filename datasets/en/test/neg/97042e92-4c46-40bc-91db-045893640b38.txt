I have had nothing but problems with this company ever since I sent in the orders for my second round of prescriptions. They said the orders weren't filled out right then they said they didn't have the prescriptions. I sent them myself.  They were able to fill one out and ship it. The other two I cancelled. My doctor is getting up in age and his memory isn't so sharp so trying to get him to handle it isn't so easy. Unfortunately Humana sucks so my options are limited.  I will be going back to the old fashioned way.....Walgreens.
