At first glance, the bar itself is simple, spacious and not terribly offensive. Early in the evening, it wasn't bad - can't really F-up a Coors Light, right? The music was fun and people seemed to be having a good time.  The crowd, on the other hand, consisted of a horde of ill-mannered college dropouts with a sprinkling of men in their mid-30s who are clearly in denial about the last decade (I saw puka shells. I'm not kidding).   The cloud of pretension was thick and completely unwarranted.  Reminded me of a pompous version of Senor Frogs. Not for me.
