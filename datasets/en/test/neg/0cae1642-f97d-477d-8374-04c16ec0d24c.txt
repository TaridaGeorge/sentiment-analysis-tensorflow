Listen, the place is kitschy, silly and if you are into seriously tacky Mexican reproduced goods this is your mecca. Unfortunately for the owners,I will not support bad customer service. Bitter, bitter, very unattractive couple works the register.I will not go back. I say, check out Buffalo Bills just down the road!
