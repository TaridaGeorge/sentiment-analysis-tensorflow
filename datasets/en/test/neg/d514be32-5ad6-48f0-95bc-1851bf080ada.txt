If bland, cold pizza delivered as much as 90 minutes after you order it is something that brings you joy, by all means give this place a call for delivery. If you also like tomato sauce sporadically slopped all over the place with neither it nor any cheese existing in random spots on the pie, you're really in luck.

It's a sin that this one of the only pizza delivery places in the downtown Phoenix area so far. Thankfully it's not the only one.
