Quality ingredients and good recipes ruined by bad chefs.  The caesar salad had no flavor.  It tasted like lettuce, water and shaved parmesan.  The pepperoni pizza had obviously been sitting a while.  It was so dried out and all the pepperoni slices were even curled up at the edges.  The crust was like bisquick.  It tasted just like a frozen pizza.  The chipotle barbecue chicken sandwich was served ice cold, which I guess is ok but they really need to warn you.  It's not too much of a stretch to assume a barbecue sandwich will be hot.  $17 dollars later, and we're still hungry.  

Their routine is way too complicated for them not to be on the lookout for newbies and tell them what to do.  They seemed to get their entertainment sitting quietly behind their counters watching all the customers wander around aimlessly like bumper cars.  Thanks guys.
