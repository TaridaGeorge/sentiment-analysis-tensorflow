My feet were frozen in place.. I couldn't back out now! My friend dragged me into this place for karaoke.. as soon as I walked in the door I wanted to turn around and walk back out. This place is 'the' dive gay bar in town.. there was some horrid karaoke going on in the front and some incoherent benefit show going on in the back.. the patio seemed nice enough but not a soul out there 'cept 4 drag queens smoking. 

As soon as this guy started 'singing' some song from Phantom we knew it was time to go. Couldn't stand another second in this place.. just not my scene.. my friend was irritated we wanted to leave..
