I have been here a couple times and liked the place and the menu.

But recently Sapna offered a Groupon, of which I bought two, and soon after she closed! I heard she was having a tough time keeping afloat and maybe this was a last minute attempt to bring in traffic, but what the heck! it was valid from Nov 21 till May 21 and I haven't used even one. 

This is just pure... nonsense!
