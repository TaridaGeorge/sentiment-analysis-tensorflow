THE VALLEY HAS GONE/BEED MAD


Alright folks, as I am sure most of my reviews already spur scorn and outrage to those who read me trashing their favorite establishments, this one cannot be avoided.

This place is garbage.  This is not fish and chips and it is an insult to the term "fish and chips" to suggest otherwise.  The "fish" is some hybrid type of fish that I have never known in my thirty one years of seafood eating.  It comes in a weird pocket shape that reminds me of a potato knish from Coney Island(which is phenomenal if you get a chance to try one).  The shrimp appeared to walk through on stilts, but thankfully was surrounded by a sub par and tasteless breading.  

What does the valley see in this place? Someone explain it to me because I am truly baffled, this food is just terrible.
