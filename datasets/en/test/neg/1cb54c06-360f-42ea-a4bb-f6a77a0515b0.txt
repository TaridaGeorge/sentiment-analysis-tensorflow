Wanting to treat my seventy year old mother who is still teaching to a fabulous Mother's Day spa day, I was excited to see a Groupon deal offering two hour long massages, two 45 minute facials, and glasses of champange all for $89! Upon calling to make our appointments however, I started to have some reservations since the man on the line appeared to have a bit of a language barrier. But, he assured me numerous times that he had us down for 10 o'clock on Tuesday. Well, after driving over an hour to get to the Laveen location, they did not have the massuse nor the esthetician on staff. The owner asked if we could come back in four, yes FOUR hours for the services. At that point, I said thanks, but no thanks. I am now waiting for my Groupon refund.
