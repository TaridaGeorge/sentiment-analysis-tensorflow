Went here because of previous reviews, which I now realize were about the the lunch menu ( sandwiches). We ordered entrees and to put it nicely the 3 entrees were almost inedible. Pork Chops were very thin and extremely dry, as if they had been fried earlier, then heated up. The fried Tilapia was also very dry and the breading was of the commercial frozen kind. Rice was also dry, as if reheated. The tostones were tasteless, We also found it odd that the restaurant had absolutely no smell of food cooking, which served to validate that our entrees weren't made fresh!
