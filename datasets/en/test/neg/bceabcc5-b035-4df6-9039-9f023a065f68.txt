just had at souper salad last week and had bad experience. I am a vegetarian and was horrified to find meat in my veggie soup. I double checked and sign did say "vegetarian". I brought it to the notice of my server who did nothing but say " i am not sure..i didnt make it".
Well, now i know how they can afford a 6$ buffet...by sacrificing on quality of food. 
Never gonna go there again.
