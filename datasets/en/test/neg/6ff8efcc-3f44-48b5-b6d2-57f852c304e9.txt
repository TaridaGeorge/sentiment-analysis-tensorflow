We thought we'd give this new place a try since we had a BOGO coupon to use.  My family loves fro yo, but this was not the place for us!  We sampled a couple of tastes, and could not get ourselves to enjoy it enough to make a bowl.  The fruit toppings looked disgusting- old and just sitting in juice.  The 1 employee working did welcome us in, but we had to walk out without a purchase because it was so awful.  This place is not going to last, especially being across from one of the best run, cleanest fro yo spots in the neighborhood- Kokomo!  We will not be returning.
