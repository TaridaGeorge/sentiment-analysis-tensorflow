Gave the Big Bang another chance, have always enjoyed it. Someone needs to take the steriods out of the bouncers drinks. I went in with my BF (he was stone cold sober) and was turned away at the door. Apparently we were too drunk? Are you kidding me? Big Bang, your service has always sucked but I forgave that since I liked the music. I'm not a co-ed so please don't treat me like one. I'm more than happy to spend my money elsewhere.
