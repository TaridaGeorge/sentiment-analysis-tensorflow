Oh this was not good. A server brought bread to our table for three with a small dish of butter(?) We had no plates or silverware. When I asked a waiter if we could have plates she said (with a straight face), "We don't have any plates. We have large plates for the meal, but no small plates. If we get some, I'll bring them to you." I said, do you have silverware? She said, "Yes." Could we have some?  "Oh, ok. Sure."
The food? 
Stay home, make a bologna sandwich (on a plate) and enjoy yourself.
