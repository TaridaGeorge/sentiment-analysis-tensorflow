What do you expect coming to Denny's? Not much. I know this, we all know this.

Waiting 30+ minutes for eggs? Arriving cold? Having to retrieve a waitress (that is not your waitress) to see what is up with your meal? C'mon... it's not rocket science.

All I expect from Denny's is my food arriving, at least warm. This was not the case. We never saw our waitress after she took our order. Ever. Not to refill coffee, not to refill water. 

My standards are pretty low for such an establishment but I overheard in the table behind us that there was multiple hairs in the food when it was brought to them.
