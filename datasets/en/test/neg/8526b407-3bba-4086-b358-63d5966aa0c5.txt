Disappointing! Not a word of "Hello" or "Welcome" upon entering. Time spent on hair was SILENT. I have never met a hair dresser with "nothing to say or ask". Hair style was not as requested. Didn't know a regular braid from a French braid :(( Worst professionalism I have ever experienced. Amazing in an industry based on repeat costumers and referral based growth. Hair was NOT done by owner, but a gal he rents space to.
