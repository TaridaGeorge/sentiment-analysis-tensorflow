I have been to several Mellow Mushroom locations and recommended this place to my co-workers. It was by far the worse experience I have ever had. A group of eight people and very few other customers we received poor service. It took a while to receive our drinks and once we got our food after waiting for over an hour, several personal pizzas were delivered to our table UNCOOKED. They returned their pizzas and the second pizzas they brought back were not what they order. They still even charged those guest. Several guest had major stomach aches from the uncooked food. A big disappointment for Mellow Mushroom.
