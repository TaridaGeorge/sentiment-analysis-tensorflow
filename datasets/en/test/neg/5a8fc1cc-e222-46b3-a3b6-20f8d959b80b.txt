Came here the other night for happy hour. Our waiter was horrible. He indirectly and directly gave us attitude. After he picked up all the finished dishes. It took him about 20 minutes to come back to our table. It wasn't even busy! Then he ask how we wanted our bills to be and from his tone we knew he didn't want to split it accordingly in partners. So we asked for the bill together. I believe we had such bad service because his tip was already added to our bill (gratuity) By the way, he's the bald guy around his late 20s. Food was great! but serviced was so bad.
