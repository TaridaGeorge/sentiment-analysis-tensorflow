Have been to this Boston Market with Friend's on 5 Different Occasion's and everytime we go there. All of our Side Order's are alway's COLD.

Cold Mashed Potatoe's, Cold Stuffing, etc, etc. And they serve you very, very Small Piece's of Chicken for the Price that they charge you. 
-$7.50 with Tax.

It's not worth it.

I have to admit the Food look's very seasoned and moist. 
But it's ALWAY'S COLD.

And they give you.....Small Piece's of Chicken. 

Sorry Gang, Save Your Money and Go Somewhere Else. 
Too Expensive for Small Piece's of Chicken and COLD FOOD.
