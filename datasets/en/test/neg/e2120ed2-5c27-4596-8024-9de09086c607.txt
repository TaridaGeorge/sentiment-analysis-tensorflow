I have been eating here since the week it opened. It is going down in quality. Y last and i mean last order was bitter because the grease was not fresh on fried food. It was delivery but manager made me drive back, and than told me two of the plates were eaten out of, maybe a third, so he only refunded one. We ordered three. For a known and faithful customer i was treated like arbage, and that is how my LAST meal there tasted as well. I still have the nasty after taste in my mouth. Yes, iam upset, but this used to be my favorite place for chinese food, and when it goes fromfavorite to returning food, something is wrong.
