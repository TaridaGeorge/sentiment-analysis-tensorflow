They do a great job on the haunted house, but look, let's talk value.  The price of admission for the haunted house, $25.  The price of a "town pass" another $15.  The price of parking $5...yes, ONE FINAL INSULT, charging for parking in a DIRT PARKING LOT!  That takes some giant balls of steel to charge for parking in a dirt parking lot.  Wow.  Just wow.  This final money grab is going to end up costing them some money.  I for one will not be back next year.  

Forget these clowns.
