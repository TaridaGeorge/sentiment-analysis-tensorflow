Terrible service. Went here with my family an I ordered a gyro. The pita bread was more like calzone bread, barely any sauce, 2 tomatoes, and disgusting red onion. I asked the waiter to take it off the bill, which he did, but he gave me major attitude. If I had not been with my grandparents I would have probably got in a verbal altertcation with him. But I guess I have to feel bad for the kid, being a waiter in fountain hills. Anyways stay clear of this place.
