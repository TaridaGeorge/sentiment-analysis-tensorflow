I came to Spoonz with some classmates and without expectations. However, I was very disappointed. The atmosphere, service and prices were mediocre. I can live with mediocre, but I cannot live with disgusting over-priced food... which is exactly what Spoonz is.

If you want to spend your good money on terrible food then I highly recommend Spoonz, however I do not plan on returning.
