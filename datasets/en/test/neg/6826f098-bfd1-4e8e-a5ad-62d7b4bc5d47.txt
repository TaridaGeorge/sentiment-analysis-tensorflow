I went here on 2 nights (3 total visits with my first coming a few years ago)  so I think I have a pretty good gauge of what this place is all about. Long story short, the beer selection is atrocious, there are plenty of authentic Irish pubs that have good beer selections. I've been to enough pubs to know when one is as fake as this. Go elsewhere, you'll be thankful you did. This place is just another trendy, pretentious and lame bar on Mill. 
It doesn't help that the second visit to this place in 2 days resulted in being bumped by a meat headed rentacop when an explanation to wait in line would suffice. How was I supposed to know when there was no one in line at the time?
