I found this place with Yelp for gluten free pizza, I will never bother step foot in here again!
All their pizza dough's are pre-made and not freshly made.
The servers are mediocre at best, they didn't spread the toppings out very well - the 3 pieces of diced tomato for 50 cents!
The cheese was not melted on the warm slice out of a small conveyor belt oven. 
The store is behind a gas station, that should have set off the alarm bells...
Owner/cashier has a very unique "humor" about taking my money...
Not filling at all and not tasty either.

I am gluten free and i was in the bathroom really bad 20-30 minutes later, ruined my night out with my wife!
