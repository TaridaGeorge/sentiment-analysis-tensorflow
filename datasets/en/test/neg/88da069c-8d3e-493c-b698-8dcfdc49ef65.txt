i will destroy you the way you destroyed my stomach the other night. i"m not even going to do it myself. i"m going to get the wallflowers to play bowie covers in your parking lot to get you to all come outside and then mothra will take care of the rest.  your overnight crew is losing at life in all the worst ways. i abominate this place.
