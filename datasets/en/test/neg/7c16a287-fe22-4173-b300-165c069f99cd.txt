Gordon Ramsey please visit this place! 

* Food little better than a TV dinner, yet competed with some of the best restaurants in town...ON PRICE 

* They served us rancid wine. 

* Service was terrible 

Owner/manager hung out in lobby socializing with friends rather than helping clients that were waiting an absurd amount of time for food. 

Gristle laden beef jerky floating in oil served as a dish 

Flamenco was ok...this place should give up trying to serve food and being a high end restaurant and Just become a bar/ night club and serve a few simple fresh dishes if anything at all. Or get a restaurant consultant in there and totally revamp the menu.

I almost always try a place twice, but, not thinking so in this case.
