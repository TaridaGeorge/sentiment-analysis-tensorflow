Noise from other guests running up and down the hall all night.

I booked and prepaid for a room with two beds at www.hilton.com.  When I arrived I was informed that they do not have any rooms in inventory with two beds and that sometimes websites get it wrong.

Although I am able bodied I was given a handicap room with inconveniences like a shower head that wouldn't go higher than 5'.
