Food is wildly mediocre bordering terrible. Ordered the casa roll & not sure if its an off night but it was terrible. Texture, flavor & all around consistency was terrible. Tried to send it back & order something else & the older Asian man said "this is what you ordered, the ing. are on the menu." Would not take it back. Terrible "Customer Service!!!!" Nothing was that great!

I will NEVER EVER return!!!
