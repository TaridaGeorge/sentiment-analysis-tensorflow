We walked into this taco shop late one Friday night after a party, hoping to soak up the alcohol with some cheap Mexican food. Bad choice. I got one ground beef taco and one carne asada taco and both were terrible. The ground beef taco shell was so hard, I basically had to rip it apart with my teeth. I ended up leaving the top of the shell and only eating the meat. The carne asada taco had a soft corn tortilla, so it didn't have the same problem... instead it completely fell apart. I ended up eating it with a fork even though the meat was really bland (c'mon, I was STARVED). Husband got three rolled tacos, which were, direct quote, "meh. They taste like taquitos." I'm thinking we won't be heading back there any time soon.
