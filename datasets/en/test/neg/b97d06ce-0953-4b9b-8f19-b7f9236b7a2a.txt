I visited this Smashburger for the second time.  The first visit was great, but this one was not.  I ordered the Arizona burger with no jalapenos, to go.  It took them about 10 minutes to get me the burger, which was fine.  I waited til I got home to open it.  It was overcooked and fairly dry.  It was kind of crusty around the edges.  The menu say that it comes with habanero cheese, but there was no cheese at all on the burger.  I went to the Smashburger website to provide feedback, but the feedback link didn't work.  This was a thoroughly unsatisfying experience.
