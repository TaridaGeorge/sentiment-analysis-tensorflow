Everybody raves about this place. 

But, come on...the food is not that great-  over-priced greasy bar food. 
And the crowd-please it's horrible. Just because a lot of people go there doesn't make it amazing. 

The only pro is it is a great place for big groups and it has a pretty nice patio. 

But, its impossible to get a table.
