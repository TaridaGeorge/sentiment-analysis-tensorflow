Rude service :-( Stopped in on a Sunday morning to have some Espresso with my wife.  The Cappachino and Latte were ok.  Unfortunately the manager wasn't able to keep her head with the busy morning.  She did have lots of people in line waiting for food but more than half of the seating was open (kitchen slower than people eat).  So instead of giving us and some other customers choice of open tables she insisted on bar seating and them in a rude way made us sit all the way to one end.  We saw her approach another customer in the same rude way while we were there.
