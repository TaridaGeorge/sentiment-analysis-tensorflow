WORST SERVICE IN HISTORY at the Scottsdale location. I love their food, but it is NOT WORTH the disrespect. Unprofessional, incompetent servers get my order wrong EVERY TIME I go there. I wasn't aware it was so hard to remember sausage over bacon. Ridiculous. When ANY customers walks in the door, they ignore them, and eventually get round to seating them or letting them KNOW THEY ARE CLOSED. Do NOT eat at Over Easy.
