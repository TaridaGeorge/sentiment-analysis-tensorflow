The Abacus Inn was very clean and the customer service was excellent. On the other hand the food was terrible it tasted as if it came from the freezer or out of a package. I have had better chinese food from the grocery store. The tea had to be Lipton and lacked all the flavor normal tea has in Chinese restaurants.
