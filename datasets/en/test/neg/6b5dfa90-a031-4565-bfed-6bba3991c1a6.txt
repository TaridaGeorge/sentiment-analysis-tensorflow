I hate this airlines more than AA.  Out of the 6 times I've taken US Airways, I've encountered 6 late departures, 2 caused by overbooking.
Every time I'm waiting for  my flight, I always hear customer service offering $300-$400 vouchers for ppl who are willing to catch a later flight.  They need to get it together.
