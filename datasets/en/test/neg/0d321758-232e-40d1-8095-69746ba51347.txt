I doubt I will be back. 

Let me back step 23 years... As a kids from Detroit, BJBA was the coolest place to go. Great Food, Great atmosphere etc. 

13 years ago I even had my rehearsal dinner here. Still a great place. 

5 years ago, same decor, horrible service, boring food.

Last Month....AWFUL the beef ribs tastes like dog treats in BBQ sauce, the BBQ pork was better out of a can and the kids ate the frys.

The Mt Dew was ok.
