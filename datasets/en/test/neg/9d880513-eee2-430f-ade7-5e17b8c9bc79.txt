Miss Trisha is great, but I think Marilyn Bostic is a greedy witch.  She charged two months worth of classes to my credit card because it was expiring that month.  I'm sorry, but her convenience is definitely not worth a double payment.  Anyone who helps themselves to my credit card is vile in my book.
We are back now after a year away.  My daughter missed dancing and the recital.  I hate giving money to this woman.
I'm sure you can find a better deal and more decent people at a different dance studio.
