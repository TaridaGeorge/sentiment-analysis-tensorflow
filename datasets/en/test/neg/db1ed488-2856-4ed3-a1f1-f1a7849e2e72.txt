If it were not for the bloody mary and mimosa specials....there would be no reason to step foot in the new Pischkes (and still, I would rather go pay $7 for a mimosa where there is some atmosphere and good food. 

What a shame, this used to serve the best breakfast in town and have an hour wait....people enjoyed having a cocktail at the bar and running into friends....now, it is pretty much seat yourself and enjoy a limited menu.  HINT:  Mr. McGrath, bring back the old menu and food....I love the Roaring Fork and eat there twice a month, but this place used to be the best breakfast joint in town....bring back the old Pischke's please!!!!
