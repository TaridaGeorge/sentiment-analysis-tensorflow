I had no choice but to eat here... we were meeting friends. I will never eat here willingly again.

I paid $12 for a double burger (no extras), a drink, and fries.
... What a freakn' rip off.

The burger was OK. It was juicy and had some flavor it was only because they use very fatty meat and salt the hell out of it... yes, I can tell, I'm a very good cook. hey burgers are cooked well done - no surprise here for a low-quality burger joint.

I got the thick cut fries, thinking they'd be good... WRONG. Welcome to FatBurger where we serve fries that are exactly like you can get at the grocery store freezer section.  They sucked - period.

one word sums this place up... AVOID!
