This store is huge and has lots and lots of products.  I was happy to shop searching out their sale items, until I was checking out.  They falsely advertise their sale items.  Today I went to purchase their "Camp Kids" products that were on sale at 50% off.  As I was checking out, they claimed that the paintable bobble heads were not included.  Then they claimed the other "Camp kids" products were not included as well.  All of the products that I had chosen was on the sale rack with the sale sign over it.  I specifically made sure I read the "sale sign" correctly and yet they refused to honor it.  I will never go back.  I don't trust what they advertise.  If you choose to shop their.... better check your receipt.
