Last Monday I went, and the pool water was extremely murky.  Against my better judgement, I decided to swim in the muck.  2 days later I was ill!  It's official, the pool at this facility is a health hazard.  I called the facility to voice my concern.  They said they're working on getting the water quality improved.  I'm going to file a complaint with the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department.
