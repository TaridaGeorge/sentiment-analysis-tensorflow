Very disappointed.  Nowhere in the materials online or in our travel book did it say this place is closed due to inclement weather.  Would it be so hard to put a "ticker" on your website with this information if you do in fact close?  AZ has so few days of really poor weather, I know... but for those few days, help a tourist out, right?

Needless to say, deciding to brave the weather, my fiancee and I drove down from Scottsdale (a 45 minute drive from the north end of town) only to find a "closed" sign on the main sign.  The outside looked nice--I'm sure it is a stellar place-- but will never know.  :(

The had on their website closed for an event that evening, so the closed for the day due to weather is a no-brainer.  Sorry Rawhide...
