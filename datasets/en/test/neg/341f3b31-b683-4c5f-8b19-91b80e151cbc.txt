rockin brunch?...epic fail. We tried the rockin brunch today and considering the other choices in the area for breakfast I would never come here for breakfast again. The music was way too loud for a breakfast and after asking three times to have the music turned down we figured they just were not going to do it despite the fact that they said they would. The food was average at best. Would recommend Liberty Market or Farmhouse for breakfast instead.
