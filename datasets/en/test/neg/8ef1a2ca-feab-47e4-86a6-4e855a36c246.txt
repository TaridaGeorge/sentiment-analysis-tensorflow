It breaks my heart to give a one star review, but here we go:  

On one trip I had some basic repairs done to my car and the rep told me it wasn't covered under warranty.  I saved hundreds of dollars by putting my foot down and telling him I wouldn't pay till he looked up my warranty. 

Today a salesman called me trying to get me to buy some new wheels because my car is over 97K miles.  I politely declined saying I'm very happy with my current ride, and "Nissans go on forever".  He continued the sales pitch by asking me if I have any money.  Bad, Riverview, bad!  OK, that's all.
