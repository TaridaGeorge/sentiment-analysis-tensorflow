The surliness and thievery committed by the Phoenix based TSA employees really ruin PHX Sky Harbor from being a traveler Friendly Airport. This is also the same airport that kills drunk housewives! I use this airport weekly and have had numerous gear stolen by TSA employees at checkpoint C... Stolen items include portable hard drives, laptop batteries, USB drives and an LCD Projector.
