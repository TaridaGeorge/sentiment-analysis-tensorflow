The first night I went here I had an Italian beef sandwich.  I thought there was something wrong with it because it had a strange flavor, but then I heard from  other people that went there that their sandwich also had a strange flavor.  The beef was also powdery.  Not sure what is going on with this, but it is not good.  We also ordered Chicago style hot dogs.  They are not Chicago style which is what I would expect from a company that is from Chicago.  It did not have a poppy seed bun.  It did not have a pickle spear.  It did not have tomatoes.
