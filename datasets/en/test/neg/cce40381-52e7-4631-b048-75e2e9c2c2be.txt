we used to go here every Sunday...but, something happened a few months ago and all of a sudden the wait staff turned over and the service just went to crap.  The Manager did buy us breakfast once and encouraged us to return...AND WE DID..then the stupidity just multiplied like bunnies and rats.  Food is good but the staff just does not seem to give a darn about you getting your drinks or food....

Don't waste your time Phoenix Downtowners.....go to Good Egg
