I brought my family to Il Posto to use a restaurant.com gift certificate. We were seated quickly and greeted by a friendly server. She brought us delicious bread and pesto dipping sauce and I was anticipating a great dinner. Then the "dinner" arrived. The spaghetti I ordered was hard, undercooked, and bland. The (2) meatballs had a soggy texture and were completely flavorless. I sampled the fettuccine Alfredo and was again disappointed by the bland noodles and flavorless sauce. My daughter who usually voraciously devours all noodles refused to finish the Alfredo. My wife ordered the eggplant Parmesan and was also disappointed. Considering the price of these items, my whole family was thoroughly disappointed. Our attentive server was the only bright spot of the night. Our disappointment was wholly with the food itself.
