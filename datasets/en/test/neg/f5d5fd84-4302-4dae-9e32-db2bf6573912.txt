At Comerica Theater, [insert your fav band name here] will sound like thump thump thump, muffle muffle thump. Worst acoustics ever in a "theater" style venue. It's too bad Phoenix doesn't have a good medium sized venue for popular acts. I have seen DCFC and Arcade Fire at Comerica. These acts would have been great but the sound/acoustics were terrible. I have gone back hoping it was just an isolated show, but nope. Comerica sounds bad bad bad.
