DOWNHILL.  I've been eating at Luke's a few times a month since 1996.  Over the last few years, It's slowly been going downhill.  Their signature Italian Beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold.  The extremely hard crusted french bread used to be dipped in au ju (gravy) to soften them up and load the sandwich with flavor.  Now, no matter how you order it (extra gravy, wet, etc.) the sandwich comes out almost completely dry and is guaranteed to destroy the roof of your mouth.

I'm really disappointed to see a restaurant I've had so many good lunches wither away, but even their health inspections have made dining here risky at best.  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=11712&business=LUKE'S%20RESTAURANT&address=1602%20%20%20E%20%20INDIAN%20SCHOOL%20RD&permitid=SG13198

All this and their prices have been skyrocketing!  Save your money and your health and go somewhere else.
