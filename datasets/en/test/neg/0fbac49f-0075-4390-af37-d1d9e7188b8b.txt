Very disappointing... expecially for the price.  I ordered a turkey sandwich, my husband the cheesesteak.  Our bill with a couple of sodas was $24.  Ouch!  The cheesesteak was pretty forgettable.  I would go to Uncle Sam's - theirs are much better.  The turkey sandwich was pretty awful.  The turkey had lots of dark meat and was finely shredded.  The texture reminded me of canned pet food.  I initially thought the sandwich had been made with tuna by mistake.  The too-sweet russian dresssing didn't help matters.  Save yourself some money and get a better sandwich at Jimmy John's.  Their service is much quicker, too.
