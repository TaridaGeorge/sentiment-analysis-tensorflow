Maybe one day I'll come back and hopefully have something nicer to say.  The one star (especially since zero isn't an option on Yelp) is for the atmosphere, I guess.  I came here for a drink with some friends because we had a half hour to kill before our dinner reservation down the street.  Plenty of time to get a drink, right?  Wrong.  After 20 minutes we still hadn't received our drinks.  The place wasn't even that busy.  After a brief discussion about the ethics of canceling the order so late in the game versus missing our reservation, we decided to cancel it.  We definitely made the right choice, because it turned out the waitress still hadn't even put our order in.
