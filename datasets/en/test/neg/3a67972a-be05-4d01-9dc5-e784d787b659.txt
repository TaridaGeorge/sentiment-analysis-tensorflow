The place is  OUT of Place in Old Town Scottsdale. 
The Demographics are not consistent with this VERY casual, Un-kept business. 
The owner did not even great us when we came in. The owners Wife seemed very UP-scale and treated everyone like peasants, and or low class citizens.
She obviously has no clue about business and how to treat people. 
Employees behind the counter were just okay, but being served in a beanie cap isn't proper etiquette. 
We ordered coffee but no food items.  It was not clean.
