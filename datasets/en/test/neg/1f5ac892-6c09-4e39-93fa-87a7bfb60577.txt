this place is awful...

out of the 4 chefs, NONE of them were THAI.... strangely enough all the waitresses were Thai???

had the spicy thai eggplant and papaya salad..

thai papaya salad is supposed to be very tart with a strong taste of lime..i think they forgot this key ingredient... not even a hint of lime flavor although the green papaya was chopped nicely.

thai eggplant was ridonkulously BAD.  i had 3 measly pieces of eggplant in my dish.  the rest was overcooked meat and overcooked veggies.  overcooked broccoli is the worst... kind of loses it's nice green color and firm texture.

the sauce for the thai eggplant wasn't quite right either, and reminded me of the entree "beef broccoli" from a Chinese restaurant.

again, this place was BAD.... phuck phoenix, dude. i'm over it.
