This place is good depending on what you're looking for. I'm going to write this from a reptile enthusiasts' view. Simply put, this place is the worst. Animals all housed improperly, I've seen some snakes that were rescued from here, it smells, and it has been this way since the 90's. If you're looking for reptiles, avoid this place!
