I used to like this place but enough is enough and never again. This is now the third time my chicken kebab was raw in the middle... Seriously if you are in a kitchen and can't cook chicken you really shouldn't be in a kitchen...

I'm leaving the restaurant feeling hungry, ripped off and concerned I may develop some food born illness. So good-bye Gyros Express its not you it's me - I don't like uncooked chicken.
