We came in for a late breakfast and left highly disappointed. I wish we'd have gone to one of our tried and true breakfast spots, instead.  

It was packed inside and uncomfortably warm and stuffy.  I ordered the California Benedict and some fresh orange juice. The OJ tasted suspiciously like Sunny D. The Eggs Benedict looked good, but the English muffin they sat on was as hard as a rock. My knife couldn't even cut through them. In the process of violently sawing at the English muffin, the avocado, bacon and eggs became a mess all over the plate. When I decided to forgo the muffin altogether, I found that the eggs were extremely salty and to top it off, the hash browns were not warm. I will not be coming back.
