You people are f-ing nuts.  This place could not be more Americanized and could not taste more like cafeteria food.  It looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is.  "half off drinks!" wow, that helps me figure out if this place serves good food or not.  Is Greek beer supposed to be warm and flat as well?  Service was terrible.  Food came out very fast, but it was cold which led me to believe it was sitting there, prepared ahead of time.  Ugh.
