Review for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi.  

Nigiri: The fish wasn't the best quality (even for an AYCE place).  It was also served too warm.  Not sure if its the chefs hands, warm plates, or just how they store the fish.  Hopefully its not the later. 

Rolls:  Too much rice.  Too much sauce. Basically tastes like grocery store rolls.

This place is a Korean BBQ place that happens to do sushi.
