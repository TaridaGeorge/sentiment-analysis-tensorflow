The food was pretty bad. Enough for me to sign up and write my first review on Yelp.

I was in town for business and wanted some middle-eastern food. Checked Yelp and this place had a good rating.

Inside looked nice and I saw what I wanted which was the Adana (ground beef) kabob. The picture looked tasty. With a drink the total was $15, yes $15!

Got my food and it looked nothing like the picture. Small portion of dry overcooked flavorless beef with a bed of awful Spanish rice and a salad with a little bit of honey Dijon dressing. Hardly authentic or flavorful especially for 15 bucks. I suggest you look elsewhere in town for good kabobs because the food was just plain bad.
