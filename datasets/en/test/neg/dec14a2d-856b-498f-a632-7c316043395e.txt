Average food, however the worst part is the customer service.  
I'd ordered food, and 'they' missed few items while handing over the packet. My bad, that i didn't check before paying. I reached home and called back reminding them about making the payment and the missing items. To my surprise, the lady who picked the phone started blaming and arguing with me that why did I leave the packet. ..Strange people... 

Secondly, I would agree to the review provided by 'Rahul K' , The owner of the shop is a frustrated man, and rough to his customers. 
He chews tobacco while mumbling and always feels like he is inconvinienced while you pay him cause he gets disturbed from watching his TV!
