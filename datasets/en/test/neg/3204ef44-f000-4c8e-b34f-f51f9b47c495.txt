Flaky and overpriced

Avoid this company.  I needed a simple entry door installed quickly because a previous contractor had lost the original door, leaving my home exposed to cold winter temperatures.  Daniel Gonzalez at Dynasty Iron Doors came to my house and measured the opening, but did not provide me with an estimate until the following Monday.  He claimed he could complete the job in 1-2 days.  After I hired him, he failed to deliver the door on several occasions.  After two weeks, he still hadn't delivered the door and he failed to return my phone calls. 
 
I hired another contractor who finished the job the very next day in 2.5 hours, and at half the cost quoted by Dynasty.
