This is not a review - It is a WARNING.  Do not let your children suffer like ours has.

Despite my daughter writhing in pain for three days, Dr. Naranjo refused to change the treatment plan or explain why she wanted us to continue down a path that did not work. I hold her and her staff personally responsible for two trips to the ER that could have been avoided with the right medication.

The only reason the get 1 star is because Yelp won't allow a review with any less.
