Terrible experience at RigaTony's. They made me feel like it was wrong of me to have an opinion on the food they served.  Their food was nothing great.  Customer service is absolutely horrendous. Would give 0 stars if i could. Do Not go to this restaurant, there are plenty of BETTER Italian restaurants that will actually have delicious food, and appreciate you, treat you with the respect that you deserve. 

Your money should be spent on delicious food and quality service. 

Not at RigaTony's.
