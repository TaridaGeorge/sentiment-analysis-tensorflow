I love their pizza, but ever since the new owners have taken over it has been nothing but a disaster. Last night we waited almost 2 hours for a pizza, I finally called and they said their driver was pulled over by the cops and had his car towed so there was a delay. SO instead of making us a fresh pizza, they delivered us the one that sat in the car for almost an hour. They have no concern or care for their customers.
