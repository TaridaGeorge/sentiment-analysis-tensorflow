The food is definitely fresh. But their single burger is "so" paper thin. It's a joke. It's for a small child. It's almost like they what you, to buy a "Double Double" for more money. Strike Number One.

Then, to get into their place and out of their place.....is a Mess.

And, I'm sorry but they take along.....time to get your food ready, in the "drive-thru". At least 10 minute's. Too long.

And they "repeat" your order over and over....and over.
With their "happy" smiles. 

Sorry gang, I don't think....it's that great.

They need to "improve" alot of things.
