Crikey, the service is terrible here. The waitress was surly, the food took nearly an our to get to our table and the staff seemed upset when we brought the matter to their attention. Then the restaurant reneged on its promise to provide separate checks for each of the guests at our table of eight. This led to much confusion and angst. Well, at least they loaned us a calculator.
The bottom line: The food is decent, the wine is fine, but the staff  needs to work on its service skills.
