I found out about this place via a Groupon offer. Walked into the relatively small dining area with my wife and the food appeared to look good.  Unfortunately after standing around in the dining area for several minutes being ignored by the four workers on duty, with not even a quick "Hi, we'll be with you in a few minutes", we did an about face and left.  We walked over to an adjacent restaurant Pho Avina and had great service and very good Vietnamese food.

So my summary is that the food might be fine, but the service probably would be an issue.  Sometimes customer service is king and hopefully this restaurant will learn this.
