Getting in is a cluster fuck. Search my purse, fine. Expected. Take my shoes off, what is this the fucking airport? Am I boarding a plane? I'm not a terrorist. I just want to see a band play.

The convenience fee is ridiculous, more like a hassle that you can't print your own ticket at home anymore and you have to go to will call. How is that convenient? $6.75 a ticket? plus a $3.50 order fee? What a crock of shit.

The bathroom is filthy, bring your own toilet paper ladies and don't wear open toe shoes as the bathroom floor is soaking wet by the end of the night.

barf.
