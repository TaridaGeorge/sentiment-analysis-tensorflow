If I could get service on a regular basis, I'd maybe rate the food at 4/5 stars. But I've just about given up. This location has a major problem with spotty service, and you never know what you will get. Sometimes, it's great, with an attentive, personable server.  Just as likely you'll get completely ignored even when it's not busy. About 6 months ago, my husband contacted corporate about the problem. They were apologetic and seemed truly concerned, and even sent a $40 gift card as an apology. We've been back a few times since then, and I will miss the garlic fries and southwest chicken sandwich. But we won't be back. When  you're hungry and willing to spend $20 a person for a decent dinner, you don't want to play the lottery to see if you'll get service or not.
