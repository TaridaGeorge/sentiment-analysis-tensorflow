With a franchise like Denny's I usually expect two things: Reasonably decent fare and reasonably cheap prices. I didn't get either during my visit earlier today. The biscuits were obviously several hours old, the sausage unimpressive, and the hash browns not quite crispy.

Far worse however was the service. I asked for gravy on my biscuits and was cheerfully told she'd bring some out. The waitress then asked if my friend would like ranch with her fries and brought everything out reasonable time. At the end of the meal we saw an extra .50 cent charge for ranch and $1.79 for gravy, which the waitress had neither informed us about, nor did anything about beyond mumbling an "I'm sorry." 

I would not eat here again as there are far better options nearby.
