Laughably, appallingly bad for the price point. You can do much better for $8 than bland noodles, boring fried rice, and awful egg rolls that left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm shocked it took 30 minutes to prepare the sweet and sour pork I carried out of the restaurant. 

I'm dumbfounded by the reviews of this place so far, and can only assume that anyone who gives this place more than three stars has the palate of a five-year old.
