Went to Rose and Crown after the AZ Science Center.  Heard great things about this place, so decided to check it out...wished I would have moved on.

Upon entering, this place is teeny tiny.  There were 3 of us and no place to sit but outside.  It's AZ, seriously, outside is not really an option.  

We asked how the long the wait, the "hostess" said, "I dunno, til a table is clear" SERIOUSLY???? WTF...and then as we turn around to leave, she makes a snide comment under her breath.

Can't comment on the food just the "experience".  Too bad 'cause I was willing to wait.
