The food here is AMAZING. The reason I'm giving it 1 star is because it's the worst service i've ever gotten at a restaraunt. The lady taking my order seemed really annoyed with my questions. She also seemed really annoyed when she handed me my food. I spent $16.00 on the Paradise Special and Garlic fries. Couldnt eat it all and asked for a to go container. The girl charged me .25 cents. I almost lost it. I spend 16 dollars in your restaurant and you cant give me a to go container! They've got great food but I'm not going back to be disrespected again.
