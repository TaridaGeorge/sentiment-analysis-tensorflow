For my first visit to The Melting Pot, I decided to go on my birthday with my husband, my parents and his parents.
We were sat in a back room all by ourselves. Literally we could have heard a pin drop. Normally, I would have LOVED this ... However it must have been a package deal: get your own room, get crappy service.
Granted, I didn't expect to be in and out of the place within an hour, but I also didn't expect it to take three and a half hours either! Our server was SO slow. We normally NEVER have a lack of dinner conversation, however we found ourselves twiddling our thumbs just waiting for our server several times.
The food, however, was delicious. But NOT worth the prices they charge.
Unfortunately, this was my first and last visit to The Melting Pot.
