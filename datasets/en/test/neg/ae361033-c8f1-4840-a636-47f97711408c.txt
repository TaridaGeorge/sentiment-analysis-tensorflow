We went at 5:00 on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there.  It took at least 5 min to get chips.  DIRTIEST bathroom at any Baja I have ever seen!  A woman came in BAREFOOT and they served her.  Their highchairs are covered in old food.  The black and white checked floor was black and brown... filthy.  Will go to a different Baja location from now on.  Unacceptable.
