One star. Because there is no 1/2 star. Cityscape was built in times when anything is possible and great developments are being built- SOMEWHERE ELSE. I don't know  who is the architect and I don't want to know. I would suggest the person looks for a different occupation and stop practice architecture  before more harm is being done in other cities.  If the investor asked students of architecture  - or  even culinary students - to create a downtown space- the results would be much better. 
There is no design. There is no interesting use of building materials. There is no landscape architecture. It is SAD.  I predict that it will be torn down within 10 years. So far all my predictions came true.
