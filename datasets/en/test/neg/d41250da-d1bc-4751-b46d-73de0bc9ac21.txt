whenever we've gone there, there's rarely anyone to help you. The lady at the cutting table always seems overwhelmed, too.  The checkout line is long and atrocious. Last night we went in so I could look for a pattern to make my son a Christmas jacket out of velvet. None of their books had patterns for special occasions for boys, and of course there was no one to be found except a lady vacuuming who didn't look like she wanted to talk to anyone (or maybe she didn't speak English and that's why she didn't make eye contact).
