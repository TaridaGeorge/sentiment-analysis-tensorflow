I so badly want a Chicago style Italian beef joint near my house - and though I live just a few blocks away  - Luke's of Chicago is not it. 

I've been here twice - each time brimming with optimism at the hope of getting an approximation of the real deal.  Both times I was treated to hard, stale bread, bland meat, flavorless jus, burnt greasy fries.

I am sure my craving will return at some point - and because LOC is the closest thing in the area, I am sure I will be tempted.  I am leaving this review to remind myself to not waste my time.
