Stopped in for a mocha while Discount Tires (in the same shopping center) put new tires on my car. The mocha was very bitter and left a funny aftertaste. I couldn't even finish it. There was almost no where to sit due to an a huge crowd of giggling high school students.
I really like to support local shops, but I don't think I could endure another trip to this place.
