I wish I could give this location negative 5 stars. I had the worst food from here today. There were 2 girls working. They were both nice.... But they made the worst sandwich. EVER. I asked for red onions, and the lady grabs a overflowing handful of onions and put it on my sandwich. Really?? I wanted to ask her "have you ever ate a sandwich in your lifetime?". It was nasty.
