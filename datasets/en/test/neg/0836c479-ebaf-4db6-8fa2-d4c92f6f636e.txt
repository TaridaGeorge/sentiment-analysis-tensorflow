Bad service, food quality not consistant.

I used to get breakfast at this particular Paradise, but I have had consistantly bad service for the last couple times.  I walked in a couple weeks ago and there were 3 customers waiting to order and no one behind the counter.  I waited 5 minutes and there was still no one at the counter so I left.  Sometimes the food was good sometimes it was very disappointing.  I give up on Paradise.  Too many other places with much better food and service.
