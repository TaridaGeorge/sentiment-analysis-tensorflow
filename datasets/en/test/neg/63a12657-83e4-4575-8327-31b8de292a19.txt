A few issues.  First, the controls for selecting music are not really in English, so it's VERY hard to figure them out.  Second, many of the songs aren't the American versions.  So, you put in "Tiny Dancer" by Elton John, and you get live footage of some random Japanese guy singing "Tiny Dancer" at a concert.  Third, and this is the important one, check your bill and hold onto it.  I've been twice, and both times the amount on the bill was not the amount that I was later billed.  Visa was great, the refunded the "error" but when it happens 2/2 times, I question if it was actually an error, or simply a policy.
