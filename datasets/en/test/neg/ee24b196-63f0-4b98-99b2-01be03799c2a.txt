"Time heals all wounds" appears to have worked as the thought of a return visit to The Mellow Mushroom no longer included an involuntary gag reflex. 

My return visit requires an update:
- GREAT NEWS!!! The beer selection is not bad! 

Unfortunately no indication of any improvement in the food quality. On the plus I realized that their pretzels and cheese sauce is a MUST should anyone wish to experience how Elly Mae Clampett, from the Beverly Hillbillies, would have made them.....just think of Jethro when he broke his toe after dropping one of Elly Mae's donuts on his foot out by the cement pond.
