This gas station makes me so angry! I've just seen one young man working there, who is plenty nice. Unfortunately he is probably underpaid and he is made to wear a hideous polyester AMPM shirt with candy brands on it. But the real reason I hate this place is: the car wash is broken often, and when fixed somehow actually makes the car dirtier.  Also I tried at three different pumps to get gas, but they were all "frozen" at the debit card intake, and I was told by the young man who works there, that the sun makes them do this. We are in Arizona folks. We can do better.
