To Tristan,
  I do not believe it is appropriate to write a review for your own company and give yourself 5 stars. I would consider that very unethical.  I also consider it to be very bad business to divulge other people's personal information to the public.  
  You are a terrible business man and I hope people can see that through your poorly written response, which by the way is completely inaccurate. 
Any reasonable consumer will clearly see that your lack of professionalism and complete disregard for any ownership or accountability for your company's actions is reason enough to never do business with you.
