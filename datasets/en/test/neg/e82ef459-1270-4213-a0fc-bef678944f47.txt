As a Vietnam combat veteran I went into this Subway for my free 6" sandwich on Veterans Day and ended up getting a ration of shi*. I showed them my VA photo ID and they told me I could not get a free sandwich. They said it was a 2 for 1 deal and I had to pay for one. I told them that is not what Subways corporate office said. I have used this Subway for several years but no more. I will definitely  tell all my former brothers in arms about this place. I did get a sandwich at the Subway on Arizona Ave just north of the Target store without a big blast of grief This is where I will eat from now on.
