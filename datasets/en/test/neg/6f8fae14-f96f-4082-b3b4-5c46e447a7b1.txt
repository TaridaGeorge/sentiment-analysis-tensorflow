Went here for a company holiday dinner. Between the aweful service (45 minutes for a refill) the loud, obnoxious music, the dark atmosphere and the food that sounded amazing and was absolutely revolting (I personally took about four bites of one slice of 'pizza' and could not even tolerate to eat it. This is coming from someone who could eat a slice of dominos if needed. Thats how very bad it was.) The dessert we got, I believe peanut butter gelato was horrific. This place is for wanna be hip people. Its actually kind of sad.
