The yelpers that found stuff here must have really dug deep because I did not find a single thing.  Prices are cheap, but a lot of the clothes looks worn or is defective or has stains, holes, or rips.  I would only come here for shoes.  Most of the bags have something wrong with them -- stain, broken zipper, missing pieces.  One of the designer bags, the name is escaping me right now, actually had "fake" written inside it in black marker next to the price.  At least they weren't trying to pass it off as real.

Nordstrom Rack is WAY better and cleaner.
