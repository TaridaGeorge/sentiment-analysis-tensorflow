What can really be said about starbucks that hasn't already? What seems to be 10 years ago awesome coffee has turned into todays "meh... ive had better."

This is the location inside the safeway. I usually stick to a tea, but if you're looking for coffee close to this area, try lola's on central about .2 miles away.
