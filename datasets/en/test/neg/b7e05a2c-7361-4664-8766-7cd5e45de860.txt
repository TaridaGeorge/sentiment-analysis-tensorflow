First of all, if there is any indication that this place might be busy, turn around and find a new place to eat. It's not unusual for the wait for your food to be up to 2hrs!

We ordered a salad and a sandwich to go and waited over an hour for it. The salad came out within 15 minutes, but the sandwich took so long that by the time I was ready to eat my salad it was a wilted, slimy mess. The owner was not helpful at all and we asked her to check on our ticket she just said, "Yeah, it's up there." 

This place has a small kitchen and when there is a large crowd it is just possible or them to keep up with the demand. 

Crappy service, high prices, and a flaw in organization has lost them a customer.
