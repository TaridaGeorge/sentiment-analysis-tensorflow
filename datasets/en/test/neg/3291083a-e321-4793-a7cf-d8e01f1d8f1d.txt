I ate there last night on the patio, where restaurant workers were taking soil from the peri-canal area where clearly people had been walking their dogs, filling and passing used plant containers with holes in the bottom over the fence, dust spewing all over. When I pointed this out to management as likely unsanitary to diners, I was ignored. When I again insisted that this should cease during service, the owner first insisted he hadn't been aware, then stated he had asked them to stop 20 minutes ago. The food was mediocre at best, and in this era of food-borne illness, I would avoid it. If they have so little concern about their diners' health to be tossing around buckets of dust during dinner on a windy day, who knows what's going on in the kitchen.
