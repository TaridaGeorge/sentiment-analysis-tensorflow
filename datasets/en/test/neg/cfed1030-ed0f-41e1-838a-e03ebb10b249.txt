Just when it looked like a normal parking lot I drove back and found a plethora of open parking spots... but then they all said reserved for such and such business (not Oreganos).  They managed to do it again - find a location with inadequate parking, except this one's in mesa.  Restaurant size was better than the others, but it is plagued with Millennial college kids from across the street.  

Food & menu are no different than the other locations as far as I can tell, and thankfully I was in and out rather quickly with my 2 slices and Hefe-Weizen.  Service was a little slow which is frustrating when you're at the bar and you see the bartender having personal conversations with other staff.
