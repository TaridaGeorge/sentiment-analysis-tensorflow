My dog has fine hair that naturally tangles and, despite the daily brush, gets slightly matted at times in a couple of spots; when I say slightly, I mean it: I can fix it with a comb in just a few minutes.
 It used to be no problem when we lived in another state, where I would take her to a Petsmart salon and she would come out with a nice cut. 
Here, at this location, they don't bother brushing her and insist on shaving her every single time, plus they charge extra for having to deal with matted hair. 
It feels as if they look for the easiest way to deal with her rather than give full attention. 

Must off to find a more dedicated groomer.
