Our family has been taking our vehicles to Blackwell Automotive for 4 years.  They have always been a little on the pricey side, but we have felt that they do a great job so we paid it.  However, the transmission light came on in our vehicle and we took it in to them to get it fixed with a whopping estimate of just over $7000 to repair the transmission.  Well we decided to get a second opinion, and I am so glad we did.  We took it to 2 Wrenches and they fixed it (a leak) for just over $400.  So you do the math and choose another garage with honest mechanics to do your repair.  So much for customer loyalty.
