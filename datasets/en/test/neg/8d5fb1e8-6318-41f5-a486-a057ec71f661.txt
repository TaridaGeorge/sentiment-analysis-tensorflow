We had dinner last night at the Cafe Bink, Saturday May 20. There were 7 in our party. We ordered from the special menu for Arizona Resturant week. The food was bland and way over priced. One ordered from the menu; the lamb was dry and barely warm. The service was terrible. We waited almost 30 minutes between courses, while other tables received there food in a reasonable time. The waiter forgot my drink order and blamed it on "the bar is really backed up"; not really an issue since most other patrons were drinking wine. One has to sit outside in a parking lot next to noisy Tom Darlington Rd.

I find the prices exorbitant for the poor quality food and service and the menu pretentious. The fries were good, though. Other restaurants in Cave Creek/Carefree offer better food at more reasonable prices.
