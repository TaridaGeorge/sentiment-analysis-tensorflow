damn, I just got ripped off.  went thru the drive-thru at around noon, got home and realized that what is usually fresh orange chicken is last night's left overs, heated up.  the first nugget I bit into was so hard, I cracked a tooth.  I wish I had another $10 to go spend at el pollo loco.  FML, shouldn't have trusted the PANDA today....
