OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH-PRICED ! food quality not bad but not that good either. You can just get your sushi at Costco or Fry's and not feel you were    had. Food portions are too small. The serving size of the appetizers are way too small ,not filling enough even for a toddler. We had to eat at McDonald's after.
