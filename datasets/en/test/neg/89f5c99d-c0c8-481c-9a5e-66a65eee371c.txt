Wow! I was just here a few months ago. How fast can a burger place go down hill? I wish I would have read the recent reviews before eating here. I would have gone to In-n-Out in a heart beat. 
Just like previous patrons have stated, the burger tastes like it is freezer burned, the 'Endless' fries are not very good, the service is lacking, the bartender assumed I wanted Med. their version is very pink and greasy as well. 
Only positive is the beer. 
Next time I'll drive out of my way to a close Red Robin. Everything is much better there.
