We just ate at the location in Goodyear, AZ.  My husband had a chicken sandwich and I had a "build your own hamburger." They only have one type of a bun for the sandwiches, and it is like a soggy piece of a dinner roll which has a "honey-sweet" taste to it.  Just horrible.  On top of that, when the bill came, my burger was $13.50 since I did a build your own.  The menu says $8.00, does not say anywhere that each additional item is a dollar that you add.  Will never go back there, and it is a shame since it is so close.
