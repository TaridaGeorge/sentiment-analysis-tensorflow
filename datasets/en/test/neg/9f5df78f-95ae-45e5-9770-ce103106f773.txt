I travel to Arizona all the time and tend to end up at Mill Ave..... I have tried to go to The Big Bang and all I have to say is Classless. They think they are so pretentious. They kick you out if you seem to be having a good time but really they are just rude and the bouncers think that they are better than everyone in that place. They have a cover charge which i think is rediculous! I will not be going there...there are so many other great bars on mill that I can enjoy a drink with out feeling like they make me feel (Low Class)
