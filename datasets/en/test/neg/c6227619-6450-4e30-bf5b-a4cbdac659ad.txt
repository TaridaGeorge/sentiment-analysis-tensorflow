Horrible customer service. The waitress was very indifferent and could care less about serving us though they were not very busy. Had to flag her down to order. The food did come quickly, but then I had to flag her down to for the check, and then finally to pay. Craziness!

The food was so-so. The coconut milk soup was too strong, and the spicy basil leaf wasn't very good either. The Pa-nang was good.
