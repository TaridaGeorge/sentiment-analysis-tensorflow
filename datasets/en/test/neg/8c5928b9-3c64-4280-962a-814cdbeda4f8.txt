This is the closet Vietnamese restaurant by my house.  With such high ratings, I was excited to go.  The pho, bun, and nouc nam sauce was not to my par or even close. I'm feel bad for saying, but this is by far the worst Vietnamese food I've eaten.  I miss my San Jose & Vegas viet food!! :(  Where can I get good Asian food around here??!!
