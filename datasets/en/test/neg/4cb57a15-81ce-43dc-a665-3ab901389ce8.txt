I went here with my best friend recently. Her fish was dried out and full of bones and the waitress acted incredibly rude and pious to us. I ordered a quesadilla, and it came in a little basket cut up and stacked, was incredibly thin and tiny, and tasted funky and gave me a bad aftertaste that lasted all night. We're never coming back to Tempe Markeplace, let alone King's Fish House.
