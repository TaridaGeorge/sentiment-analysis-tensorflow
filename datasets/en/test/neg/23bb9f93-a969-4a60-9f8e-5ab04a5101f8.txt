PLEASE HEED WARNING!!! Do not shop here.  Mold on the refrigerators, terrible customer service.  The only reason I even bought a frig from here is because I was low on cash, worst mistake of my life.  They delivered a broken refrigerator to my home, had to throw away spoiled food.  Not only that the delivery driver walked the item into my car leaving a dent.  When I called about insurance to get my car fixed the guy tells me to bring it into the appliance store to be fixed.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  Had a warranty on the frig they wont fix it.  Needless to say I called a JAG lawyer and my own insurance so I will be taking this to court.  Please save your time and money.
