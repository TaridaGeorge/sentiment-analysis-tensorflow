I usually love Einsteins.  I love their blackberry lemonade and their six cheese bagels.  However I do not love this location.  It is right around the corner from my house, I do not even have to leave my residential roads to enter here, but I will never go here again.  Why do you ask?  It is because they have the worst customer service ever.  Every time I have been in here (which is about 6-7) they are very rude to me.  I do not know why.  I do not know if they are having a bad day or what but they are extremely unfriendly here, and its not always the same person. They lost my business for good.
