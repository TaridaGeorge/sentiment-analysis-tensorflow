Good place to get drinks. But the sushi here is awful. Very skimpy cuts of fish and I find when I go to their flying fish sunday night the sushi tastes and smells fishy. (sushi should never smell) The service has been slow every time I've been there. If you want good sushi in Tempe go to Kabuki or Sushi Eye.
