The waitress sucks. She's super rude. Don't let her wait on u. On my friends 1st visit she ordered a Malibu and rum. The waitress scoffed and said "this is a brewery not a bar, honey..." RUDE!  It was her 1st time and she was actually embarrassed by the comment.  She probably won't be going back.  Then we got yelled at b/c we stood at the game table too long. I can't say enough to describe how bad the service is.  When I asked for the manager the guy said he was "sort of a manager".  I told him of our problem with the waitress and I'm guessing he passed along the message b/c for the rest of the night she gave me the dirtiest looks from across the bar.
