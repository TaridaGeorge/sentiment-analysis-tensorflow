This place is just as pretentious and uncomfortable as any uncomfortable and pretentious place I have ever had the displeasure of wasting my time and money. 
The food was boring, the service was unfriendly and almost non existent, parking was lousy, the food is overpriced, and the ambiance, if any, was drowned out by the incessant blaring music. 
This is the typical place where people with lap tops sit around discussing their greatest business and work ventures making sure everybody around them is, of course, aware how great they are and how cool they are. 
I don't recommend this place to any body that actually knows what good food is, what good ambiance is, and what good service is.
