OH MAHHH GOSH, what retards they have working here. Came in to pay for my phone bill and literally stood in line for 40 effing minutes. They had TWO ppl out on the sales floor that afternoon and the store was freaking packed. Really? What genius decided to schedule TWO freaking meat-heads who knew diddly squat about anything on a busy Saturday afternoon??? And no, I don't care to upgrade my phone. I JUST WANT TO PAY FOR MY BILL AND GTFO OF THERE!!!! Do you really think that after such poor service I am going to want to up your commission rate by purchasing/upgrading my phone with you? NO.
