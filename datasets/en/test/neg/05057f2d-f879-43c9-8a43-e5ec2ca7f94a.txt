We went back for another visit just a couple of weeks ago, hoping things had gotten better.

Nope.

We wanted to sit outside, near the fire.  You'd think we asked the hostess if we could sit on the roof.  Obviously, we pissed her off just by daring to come in.  Service was slow - and it wasn't even that busy!  And for the love of Pete, could you do something about your staff yelling out orders and such?  

Sorry, as much as I like supporting local businesses, we won't be back.
