Avoid this place at all costs.  The staff was rude, they were very late on my appointment time and worst of all, they completely lied about the MRI being covered by my insurance.  I obviously should have double checked with my provider, but sue me for trusting someone when the tell me that the procedure was 100% covered when it was only 50%.  I asked them twice to confirm this and now I am stuck with a $500 bill and they are not willing to budge.

My advice, find an honest facility...there are many.
