Went in on a Sunday mid-morning.  Seated promptly, then completely ignored from that point on.  Got up and left after 15 minutes.  The hostess gave us a blank stare as we walked out, and told her no one would wait on us.  The staff did not seem to care at all.  This is not the type of attitude and service you want from a place that prepares your food - Danger, stay away!!!
