This place is seriously not good. The noodles are dry and lack flavor. My friend got the pad-thai, not good either. Both tasted like dog food smells. If I could imagine how dog food tastes it probably tastes like the dishes they serve here. I don't know about the other dishes but any noodle dish is gross here. Couldn't even push myself to eat half. The staff was helpful and asked if we were okay and we just were straight up with them that the food was not appetizing. There wasn't a solution to the problem so we just got the check and got up out of there.
