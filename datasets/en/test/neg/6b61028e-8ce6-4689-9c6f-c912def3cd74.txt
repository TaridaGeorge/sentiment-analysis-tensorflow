Besides the girl at the counter being friendly, this is as bad as it gets. Fake flavor, sickly sweet and runny, no substance yogurt. As a bonus, you'll enjoy the pretentious ambiance with loud, irritating music. All the positive reviews must be from people who have lived in Arizona too long to know what good food is supposed to taste like. McDonald's ice cream is much better than this tripe.
