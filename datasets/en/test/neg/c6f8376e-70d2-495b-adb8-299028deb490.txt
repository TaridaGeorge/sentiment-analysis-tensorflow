I thought that I might have found a replacement for Discount Tire. These guys were really close to my house, sold tires and did oil changes. So my daughter's car needed a front end alignment...why not try them. I looked online and called the number as it said I could make an appointment. Nice! Um...no. Called them and they said that they don't take appointments. Mmmm....k. So I asked how much an alignment was and they said 69.99. Cool! Great price! So I have my daughter drop her car off. When I pick it up....79.99 for the alignment.  I paid. I don't quibble about ten bucks, but I won't go back. Dishonesty may have gotten them ten washingtons....but it lost them my business. Forever. Discount Tire has yet to be beat as far as I am concerned. And it's too bad.
