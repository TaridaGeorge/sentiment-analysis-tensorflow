I must put my 2 cents worth in about Vincents.  I personally will never go to Vincents again.  We went one new year's eve for a friend's husband birthday.  He is French and they are from Florida--so I was trying to make it a special occassion.   I remember very little about the meal because the service was HORRIBLE.  Red wine came after salads had been served.  A white wine sat on our table unopened until we were able to flag someone down--the serving of the meal was uneven at best and then servers got switched mid meal.  For a dinner that cost more than $500--I certainly expected more.  When I called to complain--their offer to me was a glass of champagne and a dessert--to make up for an evening that was suppose to be special on several accounts and turned out to be a disaster.
