This was probably the worst hotel location I have ever stayed at. The rooms were nice, but the plumbing was awful! The toilet flushed very slow, and the drain in the shower was also very slow. Then the house keepers did not clean the restrooms, they only changed towels and made the beds! Did not take out the trash either. This place needs a lot of changes before I'll ever come back.
