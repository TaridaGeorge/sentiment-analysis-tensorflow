I should have listened to the reviewer from 11/1/2010 but I figured it must be ran differently a year later, NOPE. They gave me an estimate for close to $364. I got a second opinion thankfully and I was really only looking at $188. I will not be returning because they wanted to charge me for unnecessary repairs.
