This place is horrible. I cannot believe Yelpers have given Osha Thai a four star rating. The food is bland, overpriced, and far from authentic. The fried tofu appetizer is a joke. They're not even using fresh tofu they're using prepackaged crap.
The chicken curry has no flavor or spice. It is basically watered down yellow broth. 
I would not recommend this place even if it was the last place on earth to eat. I would rather eat at McDonald's next door.
