Daisies on our table were already wilted when we sat down for dinner at 5:30 and may have been ominous of the inattention to detail that may have evolved here.

Waiter apparently cannot recite any of the beer selection and  tells my older friend to look on the drink menu for options. Aside from the disrespect, it is truly hard to read the menu in the eve ambience lighting here.

Bruschetta is poor and bread isn't toasted. When did their great bread selections drop off? Not one of my friends impressed by their spongy bread. Salad was good. Cheese platter is a bit sparse for $14.

Thus the service was poor, food below average and interior gorgeous, except for overflowing toilet.
