So mediocre its not even funny. small salad with salty bland dressing. The red sauce tasted like from a can(not even a jar)  Then My chicken marsala arrives and im astounded at the small portion. 3 small pounded flat pieces approx 3" squares. They could not have weighed 2 ounces in total It was laughable. I could have put them together in 1 large bite. Any one who likes or raves about this place  most likely loved high school cafeteria food and ha d  a Mom that rarely cooked
