Don't fly through Phoenix. 

Getting from one gate to another required leaving the secure area, taking a bus, and going through security a second time, which in my case meant it took more than 45 minutes to get between connecting flights. Additionally, the planes here board 45 minutes before takeoff instead of 30 (the standard), so my 1.5 hour layover barely allowed me time to pee before boarding - nevermind finding anything to eat. 

Then we had a runway delay that meant sitting still for half an hour on what was supposed to be a 50 minute flight. To top it off, my bags didn't make it to my connecting flight, and are apparently still somewhere in Phoenix - a day later. 

Bad, bad experience. Never routing through here, or with US Airways, again.
