Gave birth to my daughter here in March. I was excited after hearing all the great things about this hospital. The staff was rude and incompetent from the moment we walked in the door. The nurses were subpar and it took forever to even get into a room after waiting in labor 6 hours and having a csection. The room was tiny and wasn't the one they had promised everyone when we took the tour and pre-registered. The food was horrible too. (yes, I'm aware hospitals food is never that decent!) 
Thank god for a great on-call surgeon (wouldn't you know my wonderful doctor went out of town that weekend) and an amazing team + anesthiologist who made my birthing experience somewhat decent. Otherwise this place is horrible and I will avoid this place like the plague. Please think before using their maternity services!!
