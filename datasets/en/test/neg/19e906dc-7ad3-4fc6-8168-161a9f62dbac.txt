This was my first time eating here and well.....it was the most disgusting soul food I've ever eaten in my life!!! I ordered fried chicken, sweet potatoes, & red beans. The chicken had no seasoning or flavor. I bet my 10 yr old brother could cook better chicken. The red beans same thing, no seasoning & nasty at that!! Sweet potatoes, where's the brown sugar butter cinnamon/nutmeg?? The soul was definately missing in this so called soul food. If u like wasting $$ on crappy food, then this is your place! Frys deli chicken tasted better than this place lol
