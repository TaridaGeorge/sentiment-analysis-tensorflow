HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!

Don't book with this airline unless you are extremely flexible with your flight times.  I booked FOUR flights on this airline and every time I get a minimum of THREE time changes.  I had to cancel two because the times were just not going to work.  They gave me a refund, that was the only good part...I didn't have to fight for the refund.  They send you emails just telling you matter of factly, oh by the way your flight has been pushed back 3 hours.  I will never use this airline again! What kind of hillbilly operation are they running here that they can't stay on schedule?
