Run over to Mariscos Playa Hermosa if you're wanting seafood/mexican fare. The chips and salsa was nice but seafood cocktail makes me sick- canned oyster on top with god knows how old squid and octopus that were rubbery and gross. The waitstaff are very nice and hospitable but the food really sucks.
