I won't be visiting Petite Maison again. My sister and I went there last weekend for brunch and both of us spent the next 12 hours sick with food poisoning. 

Not only were we sick but the food wasn't very good. The chicken was dry and the crepes left much to be desired. 

My first visit to Petite Maison was 3 months ago and was much more successful. Unfortunately my 2nd visit was a total bomb and will be my last.
