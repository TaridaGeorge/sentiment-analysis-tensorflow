It took me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth without fear of scalding my tongue and rendering me mute. When I was able to safely eat my order it was very "meh". There's no real taste and it looks like they just pulled it out of a grease sauna.

The interior looks like they gutted a Chompies and tried to fill it in a quarter of the space.

The service was mediocre at best. For a place that small and with all the waiters going around, how hard is it to drop by the table more than twice?

There's nothing really NY about this place. The rape scene with Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant would've been a more enjoyable and a NY experience than eating at this place was.
