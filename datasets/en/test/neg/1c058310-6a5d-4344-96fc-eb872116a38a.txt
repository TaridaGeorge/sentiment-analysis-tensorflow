I wouldn't even give this place a star dis freaking scusssting!!!!!! We went in at 7pm and the food was cold and stiff. They didn't put anything new out and we didn't get one refill. We were the only ones in there. My friend said it's horrible as well. I should've listened.. Un professional staff. Let their kids run around wild screaming while we ate and  they were picking at the buffet...... Never again. I doubt happy buffet will be there long I've grown up in the slope and nothing lasts in that spot any ways thank god!
