Went on a Sunday night around 8:30 for 2 beers and it was next to dead.  I can see why.  Bartender, an "attractive" young female, was at best ambivalent.  Tried to make conversation, but she wasn't interested in talking, at lesat to this first-timer.  She spent a good part of the time either eating or texting.  When I got bill, it referred to me  (customer) as "Dude."  I may be one, but not in your establishment; it wouldn't have done me good to confront her about this failure in  professionalism.  First-timer and last-timer, at least at this branch.
