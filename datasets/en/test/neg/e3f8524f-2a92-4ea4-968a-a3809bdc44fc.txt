Bought a Groupon that included 18 holes, bucket of range balls, and cart. The range was closed and there were kids running around the course playing frisbee golf. This wasn't mentioned when I checked in otherwise I wouldn't have played. I ended up only playing 9 holes because it was annoying waiting for the frisbee golfers. I won't be back.
