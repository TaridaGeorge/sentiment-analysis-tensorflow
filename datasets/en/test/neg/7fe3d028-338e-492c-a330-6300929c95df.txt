Worst experience ever at a restaurant/bar!  Rode the light rail to Mill in my trademark skimpy blue shorts.  Walked up Mill and heard about this place, decided to try it out.  Went in and the staff was less than courteous.  I guess only the employees can dress in skimpy attire.  I ordered a beer and soup, then I asked for a group shot with the girls and was so rudely denied, I immediately got up and walked out without finishing my beer or waiting for the soup.  Hooters, upstairs, on the other hand, on a different date, was a refreshing experience by comparison.  The girls loved me and we had a great time, and they were more than happy to pose with me in my miniskirt.  Next time, skip the Library.
