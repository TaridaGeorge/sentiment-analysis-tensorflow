I really wanted to like this place - close to home, simple menu of burgers and fries, nice look. I even gave it a second chance, but no more. The first time we went the service was tepid at best. The food was okay. The second time I went, the counter guy had his back turned to the counter and kept talking on the phone even though we were waiting to order. He was surly and went outside and spit. Eeewww. Again, the food was okay but the counter guy left such a bad impression I was kind of grossed out eating it.

It's a shame because it looks like someone spent some bucks setting this place up. Too bad the owner seems to be MIA - I can't see this place staying around too much longer.
