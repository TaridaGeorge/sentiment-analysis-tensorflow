What a difference from our last visits. We're used to good food & service at Greene House but this time we had neither. Our meals took over 50 minutes to be brought to the table. Pork tenderloin  was undercooked & the pasta tasted "off". The restaurant was fairly busy and we heard complaints from nearby tables as well. Hopefully they get back on track.
