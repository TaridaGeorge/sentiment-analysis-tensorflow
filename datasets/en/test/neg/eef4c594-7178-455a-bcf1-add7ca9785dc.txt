There is a new chicken quesidilla that has breaded chicken in it. The 1st time it was ordered it was burnt and folded very strange. Didn't taste good at all. Second looked better but still had breaded chicken in it. Management did not offer to refund us for 1st ruined item but offered another item like an appetizer for free and then was rude when we commented about the fact that we didn't like the fact the chicken was breaded. Bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit.
