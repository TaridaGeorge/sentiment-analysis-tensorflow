I arrived mid-day, with one goal in mind - buying a new mattress for the guest room.  This should have been a very quick purchase, since I pretty much knew exactly what I wanted.  Unfortunately, the salesperson didn't even bother to acknowledge my presence for over 5 minutes.  Finally, I got a quick "hi", and he went back to his other customer.  I walked up and down every aisle in the store, waiting, waiting, waiting, while he walked them from bed to bed while they tried laying on each one.  Seriously? I could have chosen and paid for my bed in the amount of time it took them to try out just one!  Someone needs to instruct him on handling multiple customers at once.  Two isn't really that many! Since the salesman was clearly more interested in serving them, I left and bought my bed at Mattress Firm instead.
