Rolls were the best part of the meal.  I have had my share of hamburgers and the one I had here was so bad that I couldn't even finish it.  Plus my wife could barely cut the steak on her "greek" sandwich.  I would not recommend...forgot to mention that it smelled like sour mop water when we walked in the door.
