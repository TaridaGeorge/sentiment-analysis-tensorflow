Bad food, expensive, not worth the money.

I got a to-go of falafel starter and 2 chicken  combo platter, and i regret spending $ 35 on this tasteless meal. The pita bread was cold and i opened up the box 5 minutes after getting the food.

Will prefer Greek Wraps/King Gyros to this place which are economical and tasty.
