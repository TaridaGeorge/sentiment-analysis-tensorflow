Just had our first visit tonight for a friend's retirement party. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! More people showed up than was expected but heaven forbid we spill over into the outdoor dining area that was 90% empty. Don't care if the food is good, wouldn't know because the staff was not accommodating to our large party so my family of seven left. Even the guest of honor was extremely upset when they couldn't handle a small box of flowers on a table. Management and staff were only focused on keeping the table open for other guest. Shame on them...we will never go back here again.
