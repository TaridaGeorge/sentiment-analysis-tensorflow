I had a bad lumpia experience at this place. I went there since I had a huge craving for some authentic lumpia and I ordered the pork lumpia. It tasted freezer burned and the edges were burnt where the meat was busting out. My friend calls this kind of lumpia "lazy ass lumpia" cuz the edges are open faced and not enclosed....hahahahaa. Anyhow I might give this place a 2nd try if I'm ever in the neighborhood but highly doubt it.
