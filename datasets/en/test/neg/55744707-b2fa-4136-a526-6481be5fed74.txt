We've been to this location three times, I think we have tried to be fair and non-judgmental, but on each visit the customer service has been little to none!  Like another review stated, they are too busy playing with the balloons to help customers.  If you are going to play with the balloons, at least acknowledge me while we wait for you to be done with the balloons.

Highly recommend anyone to take their business elsewhere for party needs!
