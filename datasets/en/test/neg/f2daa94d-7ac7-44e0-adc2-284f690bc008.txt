I stopped by here recently around 9am and the donuts I got tasted like they were made a week ago. Stale and old. I thought they were supposed to make them fresh regularly? I love Krispy Kreme donuts, but this location seems to be run by a Dunkin' Donuts undercover spy hellbent on tainting the good name of Krispy Kreme.

This saddens me greatly.
