I'm starting with the typical "I feel bad, my first 1 star review"... oh yeah, it was bad.

Tues night, the joint was dead (which made us backstep slightly but what the heck).  I had high hopes for this place since it's been advertised in the Chinese local papers, which is a tough crowd.  The community wants good food, preferably seafood, and for cheap prices.  The food offerings had the dried-out-exposed-to-air-look-long-time-look.  I could of forgiven them if the seafood didn't taste either fishy or completely bland (how does crab legs lose their salty brine flavor?).  They used the cheap high U-count shrimp in their dishes as well, but I did enjoy their oysters with black bean sauce.  Clams, again no flavor.

Variety yes, but what's the point if it doesn't taste all that.
