This is nuts. We got into line and ordered sandwiches. We moved forward and asked for soup. The soup guy was a bit rude and told us we should have already ordered soup. We got to the cashier and ordered our drinks. She took our money and told my son that he needed to go back to the front of the line and they would make his drink. His drink took another 15 minutes. We had our food, we had our table and my son spends another 15 minutes to get his drink. It would be so much easier if they had a person at the front if the line taking orders. Food was great. The bizarre ordering process gets this place one star.
