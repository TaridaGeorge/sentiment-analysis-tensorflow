I'm not sure why the owner of this place thought it was a good idea, to bad-mouth the businesses in the area...all i wanted was some ice cream, and came out with an earful of negativity!! Ice cream is happy food! Be happy when u serve it!! I thought he was being a little tactless. There are better places to get a scoop...in the same neighborhood!
