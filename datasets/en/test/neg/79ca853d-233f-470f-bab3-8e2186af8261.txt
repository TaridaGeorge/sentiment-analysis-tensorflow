I think everyone stopped going to this theatre when the Harkins Shea 14 got new seats a few weeks ago, because the  the UA went out of business.

The Harkins at Shea was already a great theatre, but with the new seats and some more updates its even better.  Its just up the street at Scottsdale Rd. & Shea.

(The UA Sonora Village 10 closed earlier this month -3/10).
