This company said the odometer on my car at rental time was 16,900 when it wasn't. It was about 300 miles more. So their misrecording the odometer info made it impossible for me to use the option to drive my rental car less than 75 miles and pay only $13.99 for gas. I was forced to pre-pay for a full tank of gas, because otherwise they charge you $9 a gallon to fill the tank themselves. And of course, no credit for unused gas.
