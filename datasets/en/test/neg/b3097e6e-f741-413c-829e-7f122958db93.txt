I really don't understand the fascination with Fairytale Brownies.  They are cloyingly sweet, grainy and if they weren't brown you wouldn't know they were chocolate flavored and the flavored ones leave an artificial aftertaste.  We used to receive these as gifts at the office from vendors and this was always one snack to skip.
