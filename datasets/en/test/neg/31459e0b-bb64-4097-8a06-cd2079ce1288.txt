I don't generally like fast food because it's just gross but I was starving and we had a 3 hour layover.  

My sub was like eating a brick of salt.  I could only eat half of it and that was really pushing it. 

I asked the cashier for a napkin. She pointed to the empty containers and told me they were over there.  After looking and telling her they were empty she sent someone out to refill them.  I waited 10 minutes for a napkin.
