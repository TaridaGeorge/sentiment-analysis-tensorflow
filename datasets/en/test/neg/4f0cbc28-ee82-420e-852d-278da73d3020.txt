I went to Majerle's for happy hour with my buddies about 6 months ago.  The beer was cold and I ordered the nachos.  They tasted "different" but I didnt think much about it until about an hour later.   I ended up puking my insides out for the next two days.  Needless to say I still cant eat nachos anywhere......       I think I will not be returning...
