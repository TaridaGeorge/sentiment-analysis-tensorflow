People came and went. They picked up to-go orders, paid their bills, got on with life. They loved, had children, died, were reincarnated as sea creatures. 

I just sat there. No menu, no water, no service. I was wearing a shirt and shoes, too.

Finally, we were the only people left in the restaurant, and the servers just started cleaning other tables. No menus. No waters. No acknowledgment of being alive. Considering I wasn't wearing my invisibility cloak, I don't really get what was going on.

I won't go back, but if I did, they probably wouldn't even realize I was there...
