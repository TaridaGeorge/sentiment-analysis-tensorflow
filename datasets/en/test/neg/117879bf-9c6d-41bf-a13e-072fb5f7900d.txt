Hadn't been here in a while and met two friends for Happy Hour last night.  Food was awful!!  I've never seen DICED onion scattered all over a combination pizza.  Probably frozen from a bag.  At 65 cents each, the wings were the smallest, all tip sections, no or very few drummettes.  The 15 "traditional" wings have no sauce, just over-fried, forgotten in the fryer.  Not "the best of Phoenix classics" as the menu says.  And they certainly wouldn't have been worth even the 39 cent Tuesday and Thursday special price.   After asking for ranch dressing when we ordered, all we got were 4 tiny cups to go with 30 wings and 3 people!   This wasn't the Native New Yorker food that I remember from a year ago and I won't be going back.
