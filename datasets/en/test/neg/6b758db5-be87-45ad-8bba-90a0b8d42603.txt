I've been in town for a conference and have stopped at this starbucks several times.  The first time I went visited this location, there was a fly buzzing around the pastries.  I went back a couple times later and they were incredibly slow and were serving drinks out of order.    

I went back today and I had to walk out because I couldn't wait any longer.  The pastry case was empty (at 4 pm) and they had to give a free drink coupon to the customer in front of me because they were out of something to make her drink with.  I visit starbucks around the country on a regular basis and this was the slowest by far.  There doesn't seem to be any urgency in their pace.  I've given this establishment several chances.  I won't be back.
