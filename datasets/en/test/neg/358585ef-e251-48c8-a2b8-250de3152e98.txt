Terrible service. Arrived at 2:30 pm. Plenty of seating. Sat inside for ten minutes with no service. Moved outside and sat 15 minutes with no service. waiter was aware he had customers, just didn't care!  Told the manager and she feigned surprise but didn't do anything about it. She was sitting at a table with three other employees gabbing. I suppose her conversation with them meant more to her than serving customers. we went next door to Steve's and received excellent service and food.
