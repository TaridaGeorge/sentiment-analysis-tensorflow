This was one of those restaurants that you knew was bound to fail in 18 mos. great location but completely over priced.  their signature cheese steak sandwich was 'steakums' minced to nothing w/ some pieces of onion and a couple of green pepper pieces throughout.  All this for $8  I brought my daughter there and her chicken fingers and drink and my sandwich and drink and fries was over $20....    not in this town ... there are just too many other options where you get a better value for your buck .  Just keepin ' it real.
