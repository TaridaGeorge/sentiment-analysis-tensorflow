We decided to try this for breakfast after getting our Christmas pictures done.  Big mistake.  It took awhile to be seated even though there were a lot of tables available.  We got drinks pretty quickly but refills on the coffee were non existant even after I placed both cup on the end of our table.  My husband ordered a ham and cheese omelette and asked for the hash brown w/out onions, I ordered the spanish omelette and asked for the onion to be cooked or left out.  It took forever to get our food and when it arrived my husbands hash browns were cold and loaded with onions.  Mine the onions were raw.  My daughter had a bagel and fruit that was fine but how can you mess that up.  On top of everything it was a litle on the pricey side.  We will NEVER go back again!
