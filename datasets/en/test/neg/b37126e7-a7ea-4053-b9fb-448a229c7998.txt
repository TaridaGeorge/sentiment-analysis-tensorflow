Maybe the Dr's will get the hint.  We were pleased with Dr. Bashara and the Hygienists.  My wife and my dissatisfaction is with the front office personnel.   To begin with, they were a bit rude and lacked interpersonal skills when communicating with them on the phone.   Then when they made a mistake with our appointment, instead of attempting to fix the issue, they refused to accept responsibility for what I felt was a easily correctable error.  Instead, she chose to argue that they did not make a mistake and became aggressive and rude.  I informed them that I was no longer wished my son to be their patient and left.  Hope Dr. Bashara realizes the patients they are losing do to a rude and incompetent front office staff.
