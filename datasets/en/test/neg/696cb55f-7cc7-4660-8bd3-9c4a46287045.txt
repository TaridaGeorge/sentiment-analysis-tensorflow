Talking stick has better slots but this place has the Vegas wheel of fortune!

Whenever i visit vegas; Monte carlo hotel to be exact, they have the WHEEL of fortune game there, i always play max: $4.00/hand and hit 1000 twice in the same night.. so i thought i'd try my luck here.. 

NOPE!

JIFFED ME! 
left -400

slots here are NOT FUN, NO tiki torches, if there were any and i missed it than there was probably people on them at all times!!

rude kids here that think they are so cool, walking around and insulting females.
