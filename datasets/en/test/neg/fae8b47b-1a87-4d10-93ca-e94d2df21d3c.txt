Disappointing service by waiter that wasn't too dialed in.  Multiple trips by our table, but infrequently asked if we needed anything.  Empty chip and salsa bowls as well as empty water glasses were moved to the edge of the table for obviousness, but we still had to ask for refills.  Food was tasty, but WAY over-salted.    Wife's Pina' Colada was watered down (she rarely drinks and she noticed it).

Overall, a very so-so experience.  I'll take my $40 to Rubio's for a better experience next time without the sodium poisoning and save $30!
