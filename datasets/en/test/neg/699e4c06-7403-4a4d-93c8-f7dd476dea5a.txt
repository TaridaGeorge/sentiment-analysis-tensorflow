The location was next to my office.  I decided to check it out.  The waiting room smells like an ashtray (probably never been cleaned), the guy behind the counter wasn't very helpful, and not professional.  Oh and by the way, they DO NOT participate in any coupon offers sent by Meineke Corp.  Lame.  

If you are out of choices, and must get your car serviced here, plan on leaving it there and heading over to the Dunkin Dounuts next door (where it's clean and where you won't be getting any weird vibe) and keep your coupons for another location.
