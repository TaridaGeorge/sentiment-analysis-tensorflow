Totally bummed that when I ordered TOFU and VEGGIES it came out cooked in chicken broth.  I'm sure it is my fault and I should have specified that I was a vegetarian but I thought that was implied from the conversation I had with the waitress and by the order.  I don't know any meat eaters (though I am SURE they exist) that order tofu & veggies when they go out to dinner.  I sent my food back and left.  :(
