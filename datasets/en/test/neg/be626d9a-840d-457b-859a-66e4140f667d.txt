We were seated promptly.  A good amount of people there for dinner, but plenty of places to sit.  We then waited while the table to the right of us was waited on by one waiter, and the table left of us by another waiter.  After being ignored for over 10 minutes, we finally left.  Not one word from the wait-staff.  The menu looked interesting, I just wish they gave me the option of ordering drinks and food.
