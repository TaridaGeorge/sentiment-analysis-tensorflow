We had a really bad experience the day after Christmas. We received a gift card and we were hoping to use it for brunch. When we arrived, every table that was not occupied was dirty. (literately), so we sat at the counter. After waiting 20mins, we informed the manager. Still after 10 more minutes of waiting, no one came to take our order. We eventually gave up and walked out. The manager meekly uttered a sorry as we left.
