I recently met a few friends here for lunch and conversation.  I ordered a sandwich and salad and for the second time was very disappointed in the quality of the sandwich.  The bread was stale as it had been a few months ago and there was nothing especially great about the rest of it either.  The salad was limp.
While their muffins are good, that is about it.
I do not plan to give this Paradise a third chance.
