Unprofessional and rude.  I scheduled for them to come out and haul away some landscaping from my yard, and when I had something come up and called him three days in advance to reschedule, our phone call got "disconnected" (I think he hung up on me?), then he emailed me saying he had decided he cannot work for me.  

Can't speak for the quality of their work, but interacting with them was an unforgivably bad (and weird) experience.
