A basic $15.88 oil change ended up being $29+. The coupon said $15.88 oil change, but I should have insisted on a quote before relinquishing my car key. They said the basic $15.88 did not include an oil filter.
Do your homework and insist on a written quote before ended up getting ripped off like me.
