Why is the the Heard museum putting up that tacky 8ft black aluminum fence around the museum? They are going to ruin the great historic charm of the museum. It is going to look like a prison in the middle of our nice historic neighborhoods. Please call Letitia Chambers President and CEO of the Heard Museum at 602-251-0227 to voice your opposition to the fence.
