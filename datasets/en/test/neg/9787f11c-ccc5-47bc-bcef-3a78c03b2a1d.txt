I live right around the corner from this salon and have been here once. Once was enough. I had a horrible experience here, with a technician who was visibly P.O'd and surly, even rude towards me as she did my nails. She drew blood while trimming my cuticles. I will not go back and I do not recommend this nail salon when there are so many better options in this part of Scottsdale.
