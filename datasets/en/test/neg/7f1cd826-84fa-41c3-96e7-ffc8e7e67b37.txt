Was out of town for business and decided to try this place out... bad decision.  I'm surprised they're still in business.  I should have done my research but basically, this place sucks.  The food was terrible and extremely bland.  For the price, I expected more quality dishes.  You're better off going to Pick Up Stix (if they have it in AZ) or some type of Asian buffet.
