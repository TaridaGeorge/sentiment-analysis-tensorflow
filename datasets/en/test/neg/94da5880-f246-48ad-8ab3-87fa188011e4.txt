Been to many ihop's including this one .. But THIS PLACE SUCKS NOW!! You dont feel welcomed at all when walking in.. The waitress sucked. She didnt even offer us water!!!!! She was slow,& not freindely. I feel like we knew more about the menu & stuff the her! The coffee& tea wasnt even hott. CUSTOMER SERVICE & SERVICE IS EVERYTHHING!! But this place has NONE!!!!!!!  Other ihops ive been too are amazing. The people make u feel at home and thats how it should be!

GET UR DAM ACT TOGETHER!!!!!!
