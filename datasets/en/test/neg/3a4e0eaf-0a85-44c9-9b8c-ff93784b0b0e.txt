Not Impressed.  Music way to loud - server was an order taker ....People smoking on the patio (Gross) after waiting for 10 minutes for the Ice Tea we ordered, having smoke drift into my lunges and then struggling to hear the person I was sitting with -- we got up and left.  Yes, it looks charming BUT there is something off about this place.  We wont be back.
