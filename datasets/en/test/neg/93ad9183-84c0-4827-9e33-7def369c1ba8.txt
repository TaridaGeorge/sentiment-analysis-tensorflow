Absolute WORST customer service at this store.

On one particular day I was in this store looking for bath bubbles. Couldn't find bath bubbles to save my life! And also couldn't find an employee to save my life. After I walked around many isles aimlessly looking for someone to help me, I came across a female employee. Before I could even finish asking her where the bath bubbles were, she had already started walking away from me! She mumbled something and pointed in the general direction she thought they were. Gee, huge help! NOT.
