This place is ALWAYS dirty. I just don't get it. Isn't there some kind of clean-up crew for places like this? I had a bout once and while I was in the team area (I would hardly call it a locker. Maybe a "backstage" area. Maybe) there was Gatorade sticking up the floor and getting on our wheels. When we asked for someone to come and mop the floor, the mop water smelled like puke. We also had an injury once at a bout and there were no plastic bags nor ice anywhere in the building.
