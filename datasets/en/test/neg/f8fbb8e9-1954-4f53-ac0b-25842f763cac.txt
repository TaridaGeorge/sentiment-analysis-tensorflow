Do not trust these guys at all!  Their vet staff is uncooperative and incompetent.  My dog was brought there to get the appropriate documents for shipping him to me and they could not furnish the correct paperwork.  They furnished everything but a health certificate for my pet.  Instead of showing an ounce of compassion and working with us they wanted to just charge us another $100 and delay us another week.  I will never purchase another item or enter the store.  Instead I will take my money to a quality store and/ or vet hospital and get things done right the first time.  Stay away from this establishment.
