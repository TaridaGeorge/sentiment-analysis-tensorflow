Seriously, what the fuck are you people waiting in those long ass lines for?  Did I miss something?  Are they giving handies in the restroom... wait... do they even have a restroom?

It's so small, it's impossible to not have people in your personal bubble and who wants strangers breathing on them when they're trying to eat?  The servers are these bitchy girls that argue with each other and one looked so dirty I wanted to squirt her with my hand sanitizer each time she passed by me.  

The food - it's a normal breakfast.  Nothing about the meal made me think I was having something special.  Yes, the bacon was good but really, have you ever had bad bacon?  They don't have fountain drinks, just canned RC so I stuck to coffee.
