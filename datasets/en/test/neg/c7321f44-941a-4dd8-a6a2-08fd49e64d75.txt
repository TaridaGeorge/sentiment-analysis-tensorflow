This place does terrible work, and they treat their customers like thiefs. 

I needed to have some stuff re-scanned after they left pube hair marks smack in the middle of my face on 120 film scans from my sister's wedding. They acted like I was trying to get the stuff re-scanned for free. Why would anyone want that if the first scan was good to begin with? Then they accused me of losing the CD and coming back to get a free CD from them. 

Terrible service and extremely unfriendly. Stay away.

Was thinking about getting a used Leica from them with warranty but after seeing how they treat people, forget it. I'll forget they exist. It will be better.

And their prices are extremely high. Especially on printing.
