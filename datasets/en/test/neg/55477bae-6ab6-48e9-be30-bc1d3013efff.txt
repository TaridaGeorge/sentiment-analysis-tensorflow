My wife finally caved in today and went to Rocket Burger & Subs after hearing great things about it.  As for me personally, Eek ! Methinks not.

The burger patty was big but thin.  The fries were bascially the frozen in a bag type at your local grocery store.  Seriously !

Are you kidding me ?  Everybody knows that the fries compliment the burger and if your fries are weak that kills the burger.

My wife brags along with the other reviewers that they have 300 sodas to choose from.  To me that is just 300 ways to get diabetes.

Look, the burger was whack, the fries are the frozen variety and I could care less about 300 sodas.

Rocket Burger & Subs Eek! Methinks not.
