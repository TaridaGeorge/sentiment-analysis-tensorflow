Filthy restaurant. Tables greasy; napkin holder was coated w food and grease. Afraid that if the surroundings are so unclean, what is the silverware, produce, soda machine & ice dispenser like? Will I be sick in a few days to a week from an innocent lunch here? Pizza is fabulous, but worth the risk? I don't think so. Will go back in in 1week to see if the owner I spoke to has his staff better trained. Time to lean, time to clean... There was plenty of time.
