I made the mistake of going to this branch on a Friday at 4:30 pm. They had 2 teller windows open and I counted 23 people in line, with 4 greeters. I had a simple check deposit and I didn't require a receipt. I asked 2 of the greeters if they could handle the deposit for me, as greeters do at their other branches, but was told I would need to stand in line. I will not make the same mistake twice and won't be returning to this branch.
