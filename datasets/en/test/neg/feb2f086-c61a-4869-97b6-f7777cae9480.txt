Pei Wei is adding a new concept to their lineup - "Pei Wei Asian Market". The menu has removed all the soups and most of the noodle dishes. Portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu. 

The good news - the decor and the layout are quite nice. 

The bad news - I just really don't get it. It is like Pei Wei with a few odd items and higher prices. The portions and prices have been reduced, but seems to be more expensive. Also, they have removed the kids menu.
