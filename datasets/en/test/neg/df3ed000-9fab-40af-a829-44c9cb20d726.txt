I had a wonderful shopping experience until it was time to claim what i already paid for. A lady named Dianne Reed attended to me. I had a problem with the quality and she reacted coldly, callously and totally uncaring. If you are to shop from Lens Crafters just make sure you are attended to by someone other than this lady.Just my personal opinion. She also quoted me outrageously high prices ( zero discount) whereas when i went on another day, i talked to two other sales ladies and they immediately offered to give me a discount. 
Lens Crafters must be made aware of people like Dianne Reed who totally ruins the shopping experience of people like me.
