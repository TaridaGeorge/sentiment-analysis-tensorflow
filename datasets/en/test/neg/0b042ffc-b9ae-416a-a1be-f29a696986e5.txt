Terrible service!  These people not only lost my grandmother's medical record but also treated us so disrespectfully.  They were trying to perform the same test on her twice in one week because they did not know where they had left the records for the first test.  When we asked them to check their records they treated us like we did not know what we were talking about, very dismissive.  Would not schedule here again...
