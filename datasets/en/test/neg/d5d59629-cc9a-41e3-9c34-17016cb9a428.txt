Went here on a Tuesday night and it was packed! Had some stir-fried mushrooms which were excellent and ordered the black tea noodle thingy. I had thought it came with baked tofu (which it does now that I look at the online menu) and we asked the server about it. She said she would find out and let us know. She never came back with tofu or to tell us if I was wrong. So, I didn't get what I ordered and the server never bothered to fix the mistake.

My girlfriend got the Vegetable Chow Fun which she said was flavorless. She took it home and ended up making a miso sauce to give it flavor. Between the two of us we spent around $40 and left disappointed. For what you pay, not worth it. I'd rather pay $7.50 for some Orange Tofu from Chopstick Express.
