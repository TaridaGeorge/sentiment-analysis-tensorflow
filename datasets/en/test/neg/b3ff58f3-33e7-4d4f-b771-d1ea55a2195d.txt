The place was packed until happy hour ended and it cleared quickly. I had a sandwich and it was made on a hotdog bun with dry meat and what tasted like frozen onions and peppers. The place was very loud with just OK service. There are many good restaurants' in the area and no reason to return to Uncle Bears.
