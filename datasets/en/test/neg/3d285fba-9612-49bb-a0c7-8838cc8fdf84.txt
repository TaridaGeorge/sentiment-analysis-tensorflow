This place used to be one of my favorite places to eat, I worked close by so it was convenient and the prices were all ways good. Even though its not the fanciest of places the food was always filling and yummy. I recently moved and would still make the 30 min. drive to get it, but this last time I went every thing seemed to taste different. The jalapeno dipping sauce for the baby banditos which were a favorite of mine is completely different and not very tasty. Unfortunately I wont be making the trip again...
