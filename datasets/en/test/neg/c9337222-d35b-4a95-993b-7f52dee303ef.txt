I tried some of their yogurt today.  On my 45 minute drive home, I got a really bad stomach ache.  When I got home, I went to their website and checked the ingredients for their frozen yogurt.  To my horror, one of the main ingredients is corn syrup.  Most of the corn, soy, canola, zucchini, breakneck squash and Hawaiian papaya is genetically modified (better known as GMOs).  GMOs have never been studied for safety in humans.  In animal studies, they have been shown to cause organ damage and infertility.  Organic food cannot contain GMOs.  My new policy will be never to eat something unless I know the ingredients.  Live and learn.
