Wow this place is like a bad unorganized garage sale. Owners are rude, cash only. They have some electronics in box, broken, missing pieces. They have a dollar section items that may or may not be new. They have nice furniture way over priced.  This store would have potential if they took the time to organize and price items with stickers instead of markers. The store would be horders dream...
