Sure if you have a crazy craving for a weird pie Marie Callenders would be a great place to go, but other than I wouldn't recommend it. The food here isn't great, and I would even consider it overpriced for what you get taste wise. Also the real reason I wanted to review this place is the service here is just awful. I have only been there about twice in the past two years, but both times the service was just REALLY bad. I mean these servers were weird and did not know what they were doing.

Please Marie Callenders start screening your employees!
