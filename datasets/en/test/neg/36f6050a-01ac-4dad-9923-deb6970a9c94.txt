I have only been to three dmv/adot locations in Arizona. Chandler, Flagstaff and last but not least... mesas delightful location.  :|

I have came to this location maybe 2-3 times and every time I hate it more and more. Why I came here a couple days ago? Because of the distance...Closer for sure or somewhat I guess.  This most recent visit was only to show proof of insurance. Usually I try to wake up an hour and a half to two hours before opening time to beat the DELIGHTFUL line that practically curves around the whole inner building. Nice right? Waiting a solid 30-45 minutes to get to where numbers are given to show proof and they did it right there no number given. I got insanely lucky that I did not have to wait an extra 2 hours or so to wait. Thank god...Never again!
