I made the mistake of revisiting 1130 for lunch yesterday and immediately regretted it.

Bloody Marys were on special so we ordered up a round.  Big mistake.  They were chunky and revolting - mine went back.  I ordered the turkey burger and my companion had the salmon sandwich.  After a wait that was infinitely too long we received our rather sad looking meals.  My turkey burger came completely dry and solo on a squished and soggy bun.  It was obviously a frozen patty and not from a reputable brand either.  My fries were even worse as they were both undercooked and greasy at the same time.  My companion's salmon sandwich was overcooked and served with rancid looking lettuce.  Not a good way to earn our favor.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.
