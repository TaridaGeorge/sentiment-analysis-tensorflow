I've been 4 times. The first 2 the food was ok, the soda bread dry and tasteless and the service was no where to be found. 

The music has been decent the decor is what you want in a nice local pub but the last two visits made me realize this is only a place where you can go if you are white and know people behind the bar. I love Guiness and it's depressing to go to a bar and not get asked what you want to drink for nearly 20 minutes. I've many friends of varying ethinic  backgrounds express this same sentiment. Additionally, one trip resulted in us leaving because apparently we sat at a table that was reserved for "regular folks". Who knew that first come first seated and served doesn't apply - they should put up a sign.
