Went for Mother's day, $48 per plate. Extremely limited vegetarian options. The waiter was either baked out of his skull or just didn't care at all. I understand holidays can be stressful on people working in restaurants but if you don't like it; get a more serious job.

The patio was beautiful, the area sucks (ASU area of Tempe, I mean c'mon seriously). The main thing this restaurant has going for it is it's ambience, I would pass on the food and the service.
