Total rip off! $53 for the office visit...okay, I understand that, then another $250 for a topical and oral antibiotic for an ear infection and yeast infection on my dog's skin from swimming and being wet for long periods!!! I told them to go jump off a bridge. No way those drugs cost that much.  Taking complete advantage of people all the while pretending they care...RIIIIGHT! F
