Came here with a large group one night when a military friend was back in town. We came VIP. Service was horrible. We ordered rinks and 4 bottles and we had to go to the bar and ask for them.  We went walking around only to not be let in another VIP spot because the idiot who let us in forget to give us bracelet things. 

I am pretty sure the guys with me were the only straight ones in the bar that night. I saw WAY too many dudes kissing each other. 

We complained about our horrible treatment and we got offered a VIP pass for next time. What a JOKE! I will never come back here an hope no one else would ever go there either!
