My husband had our Kia Rio brought to this horrible place to find out what was wrong with it. We were given a ridiculous price of over 1,200.00 to do minor work that took my husband 100 dollars and an hr of his own time knowing little to nothing about cars. That should be enough to say this place is a scam, but to make it worse they charged us 100 dollars to plug in their machine to run diagnostics. My husband questioned them and they were very rude about the charge. We paid it and needless to say will never be returning. I urge anyone to think twice before going to this place and trusting them with your cars...rather your wallets!
