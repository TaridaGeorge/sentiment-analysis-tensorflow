This place was about as bad as an airport bar and restaurant can get.  When I first walked up and asked if they had power outlets to charge my phone while I got a beer and burger, the bar tender rolled her eyes and acted like I was asking an unreasonable question.  Do to the limited choices, I stayed anyways, but should have ran.  They are not a brewing company, just a bar with basic beers.  The worst part of the entire experience was the burger.  Completely disgusting!  Do not order a burger.  It was a frozen meat concoction that tasted more like fillers than beef.  My came out pink all the way through and bar tender said that is how they cook them.  I took two bites and could not finish it.  Horrible experience and still a dead phone....errrr....what a waste of time and money.
