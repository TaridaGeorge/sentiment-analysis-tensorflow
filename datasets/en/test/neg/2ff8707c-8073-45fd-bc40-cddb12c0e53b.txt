All this hype for nothing.  

1.  This place has no natural foods.  I wasnt expecting whole foods, but really, whats the point?  
2.  They have very little gourmet food.  
3.  Why not just go to Fry's or Safeway?  I mean seriously... "fine foods"?? You sell friggin cherios. Whats fine about that?  

The same exact stuff you get at safeway for more $.  I will shop at Sprouts.  Hey AJ... GFYS.
