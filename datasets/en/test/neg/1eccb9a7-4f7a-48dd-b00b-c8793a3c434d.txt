This was an incredibly overrated restaurant. We chose it because of high marks on yelp. We started with mushroom soup which was salty brown water with a vague mushroom flavor. We sent it back and got a beet salad which was fine. To be fair my main course of trout was good. The cioppino my son and husband had was the worst we had ever ordered. It was supposedly a main course but was quite small. The shrimp were tiny with a few pieces of shell fish and a very small piece of fish in a watery, red broth without any character. My son went next door to order a pizza so that he would have something to eat. The bill was $120.00, and we felt incredibly ripped off.
