This place was ridiculously expensive!  Had 3 drinks (which supposedly were happy hour specials) and 2 desserts and it was more than I expected to pay.  

We had the red velvet and I got to say the frosting was good, but the cupcake had no flavors that would make it stand out from any other store bought, packaged muffin.  Left disappointed with the quality of the drinks and the snacks.  The parking was also difficult to find.
