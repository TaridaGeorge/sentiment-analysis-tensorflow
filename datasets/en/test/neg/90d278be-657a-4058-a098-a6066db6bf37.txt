They always seem to be out of everything that I need. I like you use the got to be glue hair gel and they never have it in stock. Also I was looking for mini travel size bottles for liquids and they have not had them in stock for a while. It's just frustrating to me, because this is walmart... That kind of stuff shouldn't happen. I would like to see more check out stations open up when 15-20 ppl and waiting in two lines.
