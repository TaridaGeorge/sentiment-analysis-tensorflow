The service is absolutely terrible.  I called early in the morning and scheduled an appointment. Betsy said he would be there between 1-5 pm. I called at 4:30 pm to see if he was on his way and she said she would check and call me right back. After 20 minutes I called again and Betsy advised me that the plumber was in Chandler and the other one in Gilbert and they were all too far away from Scottsdale, so it probably won't happen.  Absolutely the worst service ever!! I called another plumber and he was able to make it in an hour the same day and cleared the line, so we could finally flush the toilet. If you need a plumber, don't bother calling Sun Devil Plumbing.
