I'm not a big fan of this concept.  I don't like the preparations.  The idea of raw meat buffet and touching the serving spoons when others have touched them is a germ factory.  The servings are not too great.  It's a small bowl.  You would have to really pack the raw meats in the bowl in order to fit the vegetables on top.  I don't like their sauces.  Not much flavor in them.  I'l stick with PF Chang's.

One good tip though.  If you have Yelp on your phone app and you check in for the first time, you get 10% off. :)  Just let your waiter know.
