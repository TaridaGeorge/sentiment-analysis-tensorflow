It was a weeknight around 8:30pm and I guess the chef had left for the evening and the owner had to fill in because the food came out very slowly and horribly, with 3 tables present. The soup seemed to be reheated with barely any color to the veges, chicken dish was awful with a weird taste we did not touch again after one bite (we are not picky eaters), and a plain curry dish.  

Dinner that night reminded me of having to sit through an experimental dinner made by my brother.  Actually, worse because in the end the bill still came for the slop we couldn't eat.

Next time I'm in an unfamiliar city, I'll just stick to the chains instead.
