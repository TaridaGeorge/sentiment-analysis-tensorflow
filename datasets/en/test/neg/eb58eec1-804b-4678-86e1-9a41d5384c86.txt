Not that impressed.  Maybe I should have read other reviews from Google (http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&safe=strict&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=suntown&fb=1&gl=us&hq=suntown&cid=9747720966802647969)  Regardless, I took two white shirts and black capris in. Both shirts came back with stains still on them. I mention this because I took them to another cleaner and the stains were gone.  Again, not impressed.  :(
