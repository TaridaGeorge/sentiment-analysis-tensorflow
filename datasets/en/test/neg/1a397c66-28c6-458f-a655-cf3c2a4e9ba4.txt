Really disappointed in this!  Bought it in December for a gift, expired in March.  I called late February and not only was there a TWO month wait list BEFORE they leave town forever, but they were out of the office for a WEEK!  So no one was there for me to address this to.  Hmph... if I bought with three months to expiration date and there is a two month wait list... that screams SCAM to me.
