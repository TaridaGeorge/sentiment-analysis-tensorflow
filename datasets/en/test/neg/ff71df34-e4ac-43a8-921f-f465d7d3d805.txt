Small ass portions. Smaller than a normal person's stomach. One "From The Grill" barely can feed two normal sized adults. 
Service is slow, especially if you have kids and non Koreans. 
Food is surprisingly good but expensive as buffet style. 
Repeat: SMALL PORTIONS. 
All other reviews failed to mention this.
