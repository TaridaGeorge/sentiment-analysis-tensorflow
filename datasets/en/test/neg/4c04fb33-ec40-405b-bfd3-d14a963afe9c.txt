A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience.  So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.  

Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.  

Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there.
