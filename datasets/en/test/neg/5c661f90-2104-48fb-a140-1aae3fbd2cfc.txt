I need to grab some laminating supplies and Michael's was all out so I stopped here. 

First of all they have rearranged the story into a confusing uncoordinated ensemble. 
I asked to find the laminating supplies right when I walked in the door , one guys asks another and they send me on a wild goose chase all over the store and between the three of them passing the buck not one of them could tell me where to look.

I wandered around irritated searching every aisle until I finally find what I needed, only to have one guy come up and say "Oh yeah, that's where it was"   

Glad I could help!

They need to work on their customer service skills and put the store back in a more user friendly arrangement.
