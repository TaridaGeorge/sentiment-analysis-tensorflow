Very noisy and the waiter rushed us to put in order.  Tempura, greasy. Smelled like old oil.  My cod was a small serving for $28 with no sides, it was adequate that's it.  They forgot one of our party's order and acted like it took longer to cook, even though it was the same as mine!  They took that off the bill but that was it.

Ridiculous really for the money.
