Today 5/27/12
The Olive Garden on Cactus and Tatum....It Was the worst service I have ever had...The waitress Tracy...Belittled and Stereo Typed my daughter as a child...Pushing the non alcoholic drinks...she's 23 yrs old. 
That was the start then when she inquired into the salad which normally is always brought to the table was told that it would not be free...She didn't care she was the one paying for the meal...She was taken her mom and dad out....SHE DID NOT LISTEN TO HER...TREATED HER LIKE A CHILD THAT COULD'NT MAKE AN ADULT DECISION....OVERALL IT WAS JUST THE FACT THAT BEING IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY FOR 30 YEARS....YOU CANT PRE JUDGE SOMEONE BY WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE...WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN, AND WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE NO-ONE ELSE DOES EITHER
