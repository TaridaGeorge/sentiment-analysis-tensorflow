I should write this review long time ago. Just didn't want to start my yelp profile with a 1 star review. Today I visited great Thai place giving it well deserved 5 stars. Back to The Keg - We went there about three month ago. The steak was a disaster, the baked potato barely  warm...probably pulled from a turbo chef oven. The waitres was rude. Never, ever again.
