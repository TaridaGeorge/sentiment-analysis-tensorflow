I hate this Walmart and I've never even been to it.

The pharmacy's number is one digit off from mine. There is not a day that goes by that I don't get a call from a senior citizen who JINKIES! forgot their glasses when they were dialing the phone. That or the idea of using a telephone is just too absurd... They'd really prefer writing a letter by the light of a candle. In other words... They're all old and I'm quite annoyed.

Oh, and the idea of me changing my number is preposterous. I got my phone number five year ago, and the calls didn't start until three years ago. Therefore, they were 2nd place in scoring such an awesome combination of numbers.
