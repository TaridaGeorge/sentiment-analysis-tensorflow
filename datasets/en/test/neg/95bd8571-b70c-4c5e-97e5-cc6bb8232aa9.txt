I've always though of Quizno's as a higher end version of Subway. Better meat, more sauces and bread that I'd eat separately from the sandwich.

But damn, this place is not that kind of Quizno's. I was part of a seven-person group that stopped by yesterday, and the owner and the one employee had a tough time figuring out what we wanted, how to prepare it and seemed genuinely bothered that we showed up at all.

Screw Quizno's, I'll be going back to Subway. At least they're not annoyed to see me.
