I ordered a quarter boneless ham and got a small cylinder like deli style cheap thing with brown sugar on it. Not at all like the quality I would expect and it cost over $17.00. Unfortunately I cannot find my receipt - it was in the bag. I should have just not taken it because it did not even look like what I would expect but my son from out of town was on the way to my house. So I just want to let people know their quality is not what it used to be. It is just deli meat rolled in sugar. Their potato salad was a joke too for the money charged.
