Unimpressed. Have been here a couple of times (forced to - the boss seems to think this is a better "team meeting" location than our conference room in the office, which I strongly disagree with). Music too loud during the brief spurts when either the waitress or a patron turns it on. Food takes too long to come out. Food barely average. Cougar waitress loves to try and sell you on their giant tabletop-sized pizza concept. No thanks. Also, too many TVs - all on one wall and all TVs were tuned to different channels, reminding me of Adrian Veidt's world monitor wall (in the Watchmen graphic novel). Just a dingy place that I recommend you avoid.
