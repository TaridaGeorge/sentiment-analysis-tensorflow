Yuk! It's probably one of the worst meals I've had at Fashion Square. I always get the gyros at the PV mall and they are amazing! I figured I'd give Pita jungle try at Fashion square and I could barely get through the meal. The beef was dry and the pita it was on was so stale making it hard to bite through. I'm not sure what it was but I asked for lemonade and it tasted unlike any other lemonade I had before. What a waste of 10 dollars!
