If you don't mind waiting in line and then having car, after car, behind you go into the wash before you, you'll be fine. 
They appear to be group of unhappy workers that  are actually trying to undermined the process and intentionally make customers mad.  Unfortunately I have a prepaid card so I've gotten to experience this a dozen times. 
 It's unpleasant to pay $15 for a wash and always leave ticked off or to constantly tell them, no others were here way before me!  Fair is fair and their management needs to get out front and correct this problem.
