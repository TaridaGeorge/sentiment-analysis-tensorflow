A NYC guy every so often needsa  corned beef  fix.Im used to great delis in NYC and LA  Chompies is busy and they sure make $ but the food is  below par. The corned beef was so dry and overcooked it crumbles. The rye bread they use has no guts It falls apart as you eat the sandwich and it wasnt fresh today. It has a wonder bread consistency not good crusty chewy rye. The side dishes cole salw etc are sub par. Bottom line is  Az people are not picky or discriminating especially about deli or jewish food so a place  like this can be successful
