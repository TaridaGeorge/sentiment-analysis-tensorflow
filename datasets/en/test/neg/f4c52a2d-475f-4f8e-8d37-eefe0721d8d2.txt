It's been awhile since I have written a review and the first bad one at that. I wish I would have looked this place up before I wasted my money. The concept sounded good, but the product was really lacking.

The Churro was very stale tasting and not a pleasant texture at all.  The ingredients that were added seemed to be a good quality and I will say that it wasn't overly sweet. 

The staff  were nice, but they were throwing the fritters to each other then handing it to you. So when I opened the box all the nuts came out of the box into my hand.

We tried the coconut and white chocolate and the Dolce de Lecha fritters. I could barely detect a coconut flavor and the other had no caramel flavor at all.
