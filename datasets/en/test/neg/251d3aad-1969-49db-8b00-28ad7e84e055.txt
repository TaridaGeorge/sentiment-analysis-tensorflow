Oprah can have at it, it's not worth the hype.

I couldn't believe how rude the hostess was, she gave away our table to some "regulars" and made us wait an additional hour.

Disregarding the service, the pizza was subpar.  Basically cheese on a burnt cracker.  the whole evening took about 3 hours.

Go to some place like Oreganos instead, better service, food, and atmosphere.
