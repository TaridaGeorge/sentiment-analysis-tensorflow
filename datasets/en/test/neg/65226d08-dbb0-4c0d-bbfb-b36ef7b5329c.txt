Donald S. just reminded me I had not reviewed the Village Tavern yet.

Eat at your own risk, I can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like. 

I la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until. 

Dun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud! 

We packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do.
