Come on guys.  You can do better than this.  The Van Buren location does.

We showed up around 6:30pm with Groupon in hand.

The place was dirty, the BBQ cauldron was nearly empty, and the cashier/waiter brought us spare ribs when we ordered baby backs... he brought us spare ribs twice... after I had to ask twice to get the baby backs we ordered.  Seriously???  We just left.
