I have gone there many times for a quick rice bowl.  But no more service has progressively gotten worse.  I contacted the owner to complain about my experience but no reply.  The inside is fairly clean but worn out.  The chairs and booths are worn out and very uncomfortable.  Too bad it use to be a nice place to go, I don't know if it is run by someone different or the owner just stopped caring about it.
