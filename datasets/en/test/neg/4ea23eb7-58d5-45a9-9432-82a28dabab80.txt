I had bought two Groupon coupons for this establishment so thought we would give it a try for dinner. I ordered the Kobe beef hamburger and my wife ordered the Angus beef hamburger. The Kobe burger was possibly the worst hamburger I've ever had. The bun was stale, the burger was billed as cooked medium-rare but was well done making it dry, dry, dry. The Angus burger was medium-rare but the bun was stale and both burgers had no flavor. At $14 and $9 respectively they were way over priced.  The only reason I will return to this place is because I have a second coupon. If you want a good hamburger go to Smashburger.
