WORST PLACE EVER!! They have some cool things in there but everything is so expensive, and the stuff that they have in there is stuff you can easily find at other stores as well.

 They have no place to weigh your stuff, so when I got up to the counter with my mixed bag of m&ms it ended up costing me $40.00 for 2 pounds. I know 2 pounds sounds like a lot but it really isn't. I told them that it wasn't really fair considering there was no where to weight it, they told me that since the colors were already mixed that I was required to purchase it. They were very rude and it was their mistake for not having anywhere for me to weigh my stuff. I will not recommend this store to anyone, infact I will make sure to warn people of this store.
