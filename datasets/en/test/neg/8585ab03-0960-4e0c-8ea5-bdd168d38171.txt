Marcia,
Regarding your comments about my 8/28/12 Review.  Your contract is written in plain English and is very straight forward.  In fact it's so simple I understand it completely.  The issue here is that you are showing a complete lack of Integrity by not honoring your written word.  In so doing, you are betting on the fact that I won't hire an attorney to collect the dues ($78.00) that I have paid twice.  Therein lies your SCAM.  If you are so confident in your interpretation of the Agreement, why don't you post it online for all to see??  BUYER BEWARE.
