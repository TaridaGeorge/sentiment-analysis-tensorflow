I think the service at Lowe's is consistently so much better then Home Depot, but this Home Depot is the closest home improvement store to where I live.  I went in today asking if they had free standing fans.  The women pointed at one type of box fan on an end cap.  I asked her if there were any others and her response was, "No, it is August, what do you expect?  You should have bought one in June."
You know what i expect?  I expect a store to stock the things they sell, and not give me attitude when they don't have what I need, but I guess that is to much to ask of Home Depot.
