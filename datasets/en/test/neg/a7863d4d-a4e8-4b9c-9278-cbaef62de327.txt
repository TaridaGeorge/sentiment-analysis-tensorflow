O.M.G.  

Are you effin joking me right now?  Couryard, I did NOT ask for a roommate but you decided that it would be okay to have a BIG ASS roach crawl down my wall while I am naked and blow drying my hair.  

Disgusting.  I think that about sums it all for this hotel. 

Wait. I have one more thing to complain about.  Why would you renovate your pool in the middle of effin summer?  That was a smart idea. 

Plus,  you have no gym.  

Hated it!
