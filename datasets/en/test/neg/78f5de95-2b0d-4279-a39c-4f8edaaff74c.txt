I learned of this restaurant from restaurant.com and tried this restaurant for the first time for a romantic dinner.  Although restaurant.com is a great opportunity for a restaurant to obtain new customers by showcasing its food, service and ambience, this restaurnat feel far short and I will not be returning.  The dining room was closed due to a private party, but I was not told that when I made the reservation one hour prior.  Therefore, we were seated in the bar.  Very romantic---not!  It had no atmosphere and was very cold; therefore, we had to wear our jackets during dinner.  Waiter was not accommodating, not attentive and charged us an automatic 20% tip, despite the fact that restaurant.com coupon did not require that.
