The Talking Stick it's self is not a bad looking/running place, as for 270... Just do a 180 and not waste your time or money. Went for a group Birthday party,few of us had rooms and others drove in. I was one not get'n a room(strike 1), went online and checked out the website bout the dress code,maid sure I'd be in (to far to changed)(strike2). If you don't have the right  shirt your NOT getting in, I was dressed business ready, others man it in with baggy,Jordan's,and pants off their butt.(strike3) drinks way over priced,way to small of dance floor.
