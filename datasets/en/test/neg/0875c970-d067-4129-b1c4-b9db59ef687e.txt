This place is really fake - I would never recommend it!! I mean it's fake because they are trying WAY to hard to be hip and laid-back, but it isn't at all. I have to say that I've only gone there twice, both for friends' birthdays so I've never eaten or shopped there. You basically have 2 options if you're going to drink alcohol - gross beer (the priciest of the 5 beers they have is PBR) or REALLY expensive cocktails. There is nothing in between. Not even a Bud Light or a well drink. The staff is rude and the DJ is horrible. I won't be surprised if this place closes soon.
