Worst Brat I have ever had(dry, overcooked, bland).  Everyone's food was cold and we waited an hour for our food and it was not even busy!  The group sharing the table with us also said that it was the worst service and food that they have had in a long time.  Too bad.  I was hoping for a great place.
