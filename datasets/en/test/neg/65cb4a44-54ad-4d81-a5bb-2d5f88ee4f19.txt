Worst service I've ever seen! Large advertisement about cookies and cream shake. When I tried to order it she said that don't have it. Then I asked how long and just got a shoulder shrug. She generally didn't give a crap even though she is one of the service. Never going there again!!!,.....especially with Blanco on the Fly next door
