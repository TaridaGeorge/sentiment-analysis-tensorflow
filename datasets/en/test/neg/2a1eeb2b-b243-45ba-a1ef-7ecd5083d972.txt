The food was mediocre at best.  We had a Rueben and a Tuna Melt.  The Tuna melt was actually toast with Tuna.  Serious lack of technique in regard to creating a "melt" type sandwich.  The pastrami was more akin to roast beef with little in the way of Pastrami like flavors.  Finally the sandwiches themselves we're very tepid in terms of temperature, maybe that was because it took nearly 25 minutes from order to food delivery.  (Really 20+ minutes for a sandwich?)  Finally the staff was not particularly friendly, while not horrible a good afternoon and smile is not too much to asked.  It seemed they were as disappointed at being as my visit turned out to be.  
Maybe we just didn't have the right things but it seems like there are other deli's around that can hit the basics more effectively than Jason's
