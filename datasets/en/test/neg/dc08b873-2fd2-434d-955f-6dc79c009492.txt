While visiting from California we went to a few bars downtown and were pleased with all except ACME. This was the absolute worst bar I have EVER been to.  It took forever to get a drink from the tool of a bartender. Then some nasty chick with STD's written all over her was dancing on the bar next to our $5 bottled beers. My boyfriend and I decided to walk upstairs to get away from it all only to be stopped by what assumed to be a bouncer,  whom was sitting on a couch. He told us females only upstairs though we saw males up there. Later to be told by the bartender "you have to have a vagina or act like you have a vagina".  We left after one beer and went to Saddleranch where we had an absolute blast.
