Went for a pedicure and gel nails. With one $5 upgrade it was about $64 - a bit pricey for the services. The massage was also very light and very quick, and probably doesn't count as a massage. 

The biggest downfall was that the tools and inside of the salon looked dirty. I snapped a pic of the gel UV machine - super dirty on the outside, and when I went to put my hand inside, there was sticky stuff all over the inside of the machine. I told the girl, but she shrugged it off. Not clean = not cool.
