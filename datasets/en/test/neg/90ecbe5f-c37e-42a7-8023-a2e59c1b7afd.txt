Well..... All airplanes feel the same, once your up in the air it's all on faith! But one thing airline need to and should change is their bag policy! I mean it really is insane that after going over 1 lbs on ur bag they can charge upto 300% not to mention the initial $25! It really is a bunch of bull!
