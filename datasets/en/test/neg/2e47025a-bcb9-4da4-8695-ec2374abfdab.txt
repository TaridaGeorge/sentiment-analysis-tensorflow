Unfortunately you can't give negative stars...or less than 1.  

WORST SERVICE EVER!

Service my wife and I received was so bad that I decided to pay the $200 cancellation fee JUST to get away from them!  Both times my wife and I went in, we were forced to wait around and both times and was rudely greeted and "helped" by the manager.  

I found out that this is a corporate Sprint store...they could care less if you're happy or not.  I even sent a nasty gram on Sprint's website and got an email back from an Executive VP advising that they were going to look in on this and fix the problems.
