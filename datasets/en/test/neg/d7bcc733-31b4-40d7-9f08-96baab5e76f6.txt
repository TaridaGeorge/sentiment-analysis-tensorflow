HORRIBLE PEOPLE  they shredded my brand new garment.  The manager was trailer trash rude but finally said that the owner would call me within two days.  Four days later I tracked down the owner.  i barely got a word out when he started screaming at me that the garment was old.  Then he called me a liar and a cheat and told me to get the F out of his store.  This was the worst experience I have ever had with any business.
