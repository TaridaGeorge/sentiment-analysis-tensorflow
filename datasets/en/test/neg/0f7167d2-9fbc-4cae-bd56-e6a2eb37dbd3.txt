this place is terrible.  Everytime I refill my daughter's prescription, they say it will be ready the next day, I give them a week, and its never ready!  I am waiting right now for them to make her prescription, which will take thirty minutes.  Their phone etiquette isawful.  I wish another pharmacy could make her prescription!
