This Hotel is very POORLY managed.  They charged my three night stay to the wrong person, although they gave me a reciept for my stay.  They constantly  told two different stories to me and the wrongly charged person.  To resolve the error, they took my credit card information and then four days later said that they never spoke with me and don't know who I could have spoken to or where my credit card information is. 

It took two months to resolve this issue and they were not really concerned that they were mismanaging sensitive information and improperly charging individuals for hotel stays.  I feel sorry for the guest who was improperly charged for my stay!
