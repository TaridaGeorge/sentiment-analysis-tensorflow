We read all these great reviews about this antique store and when we got there we were all excited to find some cool stuff.  Unfortunately they didn't have anything good!  A lot of tiny stuff like jewelry, glassware, plates, dishes, etc....also a lot of stuff that was new like switchplates for your lights that had pictures on them....a lot of old lady clothing....I don't know.  It was just a total let down for us and I won't waste my time there next time I'm in the area.
