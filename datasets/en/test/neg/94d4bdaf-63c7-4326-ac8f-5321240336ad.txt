I don't like Harkins. I also don't like Bell Road. Perhaps that's why I dislike this theater. 

I've found that Harkins theaters basically suck in comparison to the stadium seating AMC has to offer. This theater is consistently crowded, and dominated by bummish teenagers with nothing better to do. Oh, and the employees wear goofy uniforms.
