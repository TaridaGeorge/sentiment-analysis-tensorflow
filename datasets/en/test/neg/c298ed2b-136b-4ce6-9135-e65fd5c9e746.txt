All I'm going to say about this place is that I've seen the workers multiple times in the trash area at Kierland Commons storing/preparing food back there. Items included lettuce heads, breads, and macaroni and cheese. 

DISGUSTING. I'm not making this up.  

Unfortunately, I contacted Health Services about this, and when someone came to inspect the trash area there was no food back there.

(I, along with co-workers, noticed this on the daily back in high school when I worked at Cold Stone).
