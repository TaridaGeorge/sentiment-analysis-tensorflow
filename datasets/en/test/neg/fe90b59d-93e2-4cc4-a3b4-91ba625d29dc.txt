We went to the official opening night and it was a huge disappointment. Completely disorganized, understaffed (only 2 cooks) and over a one hour wait for food! The owner chose to hang out with his friends and not supervise anything or greet customers. We spent over $200 and the food portions were lacking. $5.00 for an order of sweet potato fries that had 10 fries and $10+/each for simple mixed drinks. The burgers are comparable to local burger places but at least there you receive attentive service and no long wait times. A smart and serious business owner would have been apologizing for the wait times and providing kids with free dessert so everyone would be happy. Bottom line: don't waste your time or money!
