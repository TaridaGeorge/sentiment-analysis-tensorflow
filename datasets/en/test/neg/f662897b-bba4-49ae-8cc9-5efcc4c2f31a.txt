I called an order for pick up around 6pm for 7pm.  I specifically asked if they could make it for 7 because I wanted to not only makes sure it was ready for me, but that it was fresh when I got there.  The girl on the phone acted annoyed that I was asking this but agreed anways.  I got there and waited for 10 min while 3 girls behind the counter just looked at me then said we will be with you in a minute.  Finally a guy came up and handed me my order.  I got into my car, pulled out of the parking lot and opened the bag to try a fry...well it was cold and dry..the burger, cold.  They did exactly what I asked them not to do.  worst burger and fries, no flavor, cold, stale, do NOT waste your time here.
