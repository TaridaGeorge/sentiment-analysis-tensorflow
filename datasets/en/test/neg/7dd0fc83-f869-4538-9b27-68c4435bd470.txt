********I Found Another JJ Location ....... That Sucks********

This one.......and the one located on Cactus.........must be the same Franchisee.

Carried out two sandwiches.......both were disgusting.

 (-) Want extra vinaigrette on the side ........ they don't have the small plastic cups.
 (-) a newborn Rabbit would STARVE on the amount of lettuce on the sandwiches.

Subway on its worst day .......... beats this "Crap Franchisee".
