Blegh, blegh, blegh. I will never ever ever eat here, or at any Sonic for that matter ever again after what I experienced. I ordered food through the drive through and got awful customer service. Then when I returned home, my order was completely wrong! I was the only person there at the time so it isn't liked they mixed my order with some one elses. Something told me to check the sandwhich and when I did, THERE WAS A HAIR!!!!!!!! I almost threw up. I will never revisit any Sonic chain ever again, which is sad because Ocean Waters were my favorite. 
DO NOT EAT HERE.
