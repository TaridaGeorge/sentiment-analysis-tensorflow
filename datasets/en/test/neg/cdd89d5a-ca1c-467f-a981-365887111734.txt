The customer service here is awful. They're advertising Jennie-O frozen turkeys for $0.39/lb while supplies last. I figured that they'd be flying off their shelves, so I called before leaving to the store and asked specifically if they had those turkeys in stock. They said they did, so I headed to the store, which was about 5 minutes away. When I got there they were totally out of turkeys. The staff was unwilling to do anything except offer me a turkey at 3 times the price, so I made a special trip for nothing.
