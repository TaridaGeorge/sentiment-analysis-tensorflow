This is made of cinderblock and cement. If that is your aesthetic taste, go for it.  My room flooded twice, my patio flooded, the hallway ceiling was caving in, and it took 3 days to fix it.  And to be frank, no one at the hotel seemed to care. There are too many other nice hotels and resorts in the Scottsdale area to stay at this one.  OK, the pool is OK, but the Fairmont has a much nicer pool and kids area that is much more seperate than here.  Ugh!

And having one restaurant open and just basically a pool does NOT make it  a resort. *btw, there is a $15 daily resort fee!
