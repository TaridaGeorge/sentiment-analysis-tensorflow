Will say anything to get your business.  I signed up for a system 2 years ago and was assured at that time that it was a 2 year contract.  When I just checked the expiration date with they so called customer service, they wanted to know why I wanted to know, then informed me it was a 3 year agreement.  I will be finding the original paperwork, and hopefully can shove it down they're throats.  Customer service is lousy, english is a second or third language for most, if the alarm goes off they call you and ask you if you want them to notify the police, even thought they know that the alarm is in another state.  I would not recommend them to anyone.
