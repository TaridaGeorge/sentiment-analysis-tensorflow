A Tourist trap that will "nickel and dime" you to death.

Actually, the ghost town is cute & quaint - Just keep your hand on your wallet - Everything costs, and even the street performers are panhandling for "donations" with every chance they get.  The reptile display costs $2/person to see!

Definately avoid the Mammoth Steakhouse (see a previous review of mine) - HORRIBLE food & service.

If the whore house was for real, I can only imagine how much IT would cost!

Geeze!
