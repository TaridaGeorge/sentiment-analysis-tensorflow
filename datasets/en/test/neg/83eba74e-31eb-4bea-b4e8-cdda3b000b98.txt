WORST CHEESESTEAK EVER! 

Note that you cannot get it without Onions or Green Peppers because, and I quote, "it's mixed in." Um, OK. So, I took a shot. What I got was a cold roll with some sweet tasting, room temperature, pressed meat in it, mashed up with some Onions or Green Peppers, topped with no cheese that was apparent to the naked eye (or could be tasted), and some shredded lettuce and tomatoes. By comparison, the Steak-Um product that you can get in your grocer's freezer section is FINE DINING. 

STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! We never throw away food, and this went straight into the trash in favor of frozen burritos.... UGH!
