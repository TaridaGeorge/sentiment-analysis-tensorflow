This place gets one star.
Why?
Because of the proliferation of snotnose owners.That's why.
Classic Phoenix ridden Children of The Corn mentality.
They don't know you?
You're not welcome.
Hostile,rude,obnoxious,condescending group of assholes who congregate in their asshole pods to size up the new entrants into the park.
Gods forbid your dog goes to play with any of theirs either.
Between the nasty remarks,dirty looks and them pulling their oh so hi falutin mutts away when play does ensue,I find it a dissapointment at best to have to take dogface here.
I have never seen this level of anti social behavior anywhere else in the world.
This dog park's overall mentality is a prime microcosm example of what I despise about Phoenix.
