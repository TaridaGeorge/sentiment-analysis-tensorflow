I used to frequent this place for lunch. I never had a bad experience during the lunch hours so we decided to try it for breakfast. We ordered two regular menu items and one kids item. The kids item was split by my two children. On the menu, it states one juice is included with the meal for kids. Following breakfast comes the bill. $5.00 for one glass of orange juice! You have got to be kidding me - is there top shelf vodka included with that price? Not only that, but the orange juice is not included as a juice option as stated on the kids menu. So, we thought there was a mistake considering they charged us $10.00 for two kids orange juices. Nope, apparently not - they charge $5.00 for kids orange juice. Get real! We won't be back, ever.
