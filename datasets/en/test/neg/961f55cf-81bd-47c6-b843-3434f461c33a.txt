What happened to this place. I have not been here like a year, and everything went down the hill. No more banana bread

First, Bad Service. We stood up for 5 minutes in front of main door while inside was not crowded. Waiter did not bring us a bread. i had to ask twice. Order was slow. I saw our food waited in the counter at least 10 minutes. I was ready to go and pick it up.

Sushi quality was bad. Yakisoba noodle was burned.

Well, I used to go this place alot, but I will never go back again. What happened to Japanese culture - Being fast , efficent and respectful ?

I will never come back, there are lots of nice places in nort phoenix. just go check it out like Tokyo lobby, yen sushi. It will worth a drive, and
