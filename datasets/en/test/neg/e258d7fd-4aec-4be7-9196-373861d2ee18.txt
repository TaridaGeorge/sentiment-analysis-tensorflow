Horrible, horrible, horrible! We had reservations since September for a master suite, they checked us into a Jr. without even the courtesy of acknowledging it. When we called them on it, the concerierge just handed me the phone for the 800 number in Florida. Of course they couldn't do anything about it but offer me a $25 gift card. The Jr wasn't even big enough for the 4 of us (which is why we booked a master). The pull out sofa was broken and had screws protruding. NO WI-FI! are you kidding me... This is 2011 isn't it? What exactly is the "five star villa" experience? The staff was terrible, the room was 2 star at best. Run from this place!
