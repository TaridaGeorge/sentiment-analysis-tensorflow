Very,very bad! Did not show for the first appointment. They canceled the second appointment at 8pm the night before. They were 1 1/2 hrs. late for the 3rd appointment. Then, I had living social voucher for 2hr cleaning with 2 people, after 1 hour they said they were done. I still had dust everywhere, the bathrooms were not clean and the kitchen wasn't even touched. Very unprofessional!!
