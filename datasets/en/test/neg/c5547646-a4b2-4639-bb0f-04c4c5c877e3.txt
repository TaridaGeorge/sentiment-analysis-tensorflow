There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.

The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.

Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.

Pani Puri was OK
Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor
Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs

Not worth the trip.
