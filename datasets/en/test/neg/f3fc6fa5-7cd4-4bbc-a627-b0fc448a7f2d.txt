This place is full of incompetent barbers.  I recently went to Joe's for a haircut.  The wait was long but stuck it out.  It was finally my turn to go and the staff bumbled the list and called another gentleman's name before me.  It was clearly on top of his but blatantly skipped.  How can I trust a guy with my hair if he can't read a simple list?
