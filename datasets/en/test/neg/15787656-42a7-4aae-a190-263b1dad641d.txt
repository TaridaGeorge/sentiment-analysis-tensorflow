This spa was so hard to find. There is no good signage on the property to get you there. In hindsight, that may have been a good thing! The place is pretty much, a dump! Very outdated, and I swear it smelled. I have no idea why this hotel is known to be so upscale. As far as the spa goes, I was seriously disappointed and would never go back. There are so many beautiful spas in Scottsdale...avoid this one. Yuck!
