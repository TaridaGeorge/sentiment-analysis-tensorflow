Terrible!   Super expensive for a rundown hotel.  Poor service with staff making terrible decisions.   Water park is so crowded we went to another pool.  Not enough chairs anywhere to accommodate guests.   Everybody I talked to shared my feelings on this resort.  We are checking out early and heading to another resort....buyer beware!   Find another resort!
