good guacamole. good tortillas and great salsa.  But the server was trying to pump up the bill obviously and was flirtatious to try and get me to spend more.  odd experience with the server.  I had to try and keep the bill lower, much to the server's dissatisfaction.  good food, but very--very expensive. too expensive.
