Took my daughter to Lucille's on the recommendation of my boyfriend. Bad Idea! The food was COLD. The Best thing there to eat, was the Bar B Q Sauce. I was SO disappointed! We had the 1/2 slab of ribs, baked potato with everything, and corn on the cob. With some nasty strawberry like kool aid like drink. First of all our food was not cold, not warm, but is was definitely COOL to the touch. Plus the place aint cheap. Our meal came to $60.55. And we didn't even finish our food. Wait, take that back.  The Biscuits w/Apple Butter were the best thing we ate of the meal. Wish we had went ahead and went to LoLo's instead. Wont be back to Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ. I liked Famous Dave's better. And their prices were more reasonable.
