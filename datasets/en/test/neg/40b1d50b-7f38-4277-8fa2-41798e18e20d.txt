WOW. Went there for the first time Friday. Thought it was good until today when my friend sees they added 20$ onto his tab. Tipped the tender each time a drink was purchased. He has all the receipts and it was way less than what they charged him. So if you enjoy being robbed, this is the place for you! NEVER returning.
