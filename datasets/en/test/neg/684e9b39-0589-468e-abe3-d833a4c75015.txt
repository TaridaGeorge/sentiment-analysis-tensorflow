So over rated. 
I'm from San Francisco- I have high standards for my sushi. 
I especially dislike sub-par fish in a place that tries to look/act swanky. 
This reminds me of a sleazy date spot- oh wait it is!

I prefer my secret spot in Avondale for better prices, fresher fish, and more attentive staff.
