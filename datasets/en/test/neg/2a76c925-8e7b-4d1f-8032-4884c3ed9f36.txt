I have to say, this one is not a good sushi at all. this one is one of the worst sushi ever. Costco sushi even taste better than this. 
I'm sorry, I know that this place just open a week ago, but.. I can't say anything positive about the food.
The place used to be a fastfood restaurant (hawaian bbq) that is being converted into sushi join. but with No sushi bar (surprise).
yes the place have a great service, friendly and bright. but I'm only rate based on quality of the food. yes I'm in phoenix, but still, there are some other decent place to eat. unless they fix on how they prepare the sushi. they'll not get any repeat customer.
yes they gave me free ice-cream and other sashimi.
