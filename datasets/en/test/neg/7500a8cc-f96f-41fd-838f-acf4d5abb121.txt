The BBQ sauce is ketchup-based and sickly sweet. The potato salad tastes like it has Thousand Island dressing in it instead of mayo or mustard. I exchanged the potato salad for "BBQ pit beans" it was so bad. The beans taste like pork & beans from a can with a few kidney and Lima beans thrown in for color. Who serves Lima beans with BBQ? Yuck. If you're from Texas or Kansas City, don't waste your time or money. If I could give zero stars, I would.
