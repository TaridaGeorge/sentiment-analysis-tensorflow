This was god awful. 

The chicken was fat with some skin and flavorless sauce. Somehow, they messed up the rice too. 

"How is pork-fried rice ever dry?" said the boyfriend.

 It's making me want to vomit just thinking about how to describe the food. 

The crab puffs were decent. But, really, don't. Get Thai.

No idea how this has such good reviews.
