They don't even make their own "fior di latte", the extremely important gelato base that is at the heart of any serious, authentic gelato. Arlecchino down the street is like a gazillion times better! And, they are actually Italian!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Even Italian tourists I've seen go into Arlecchino were like, practically in tears over the magnificent artistry of the super-quality, super delicious authentic concoctions they were tasting. So why do people go to less authentic places? Well, it's like this: if one has only ever tasted generic, inferior quality grocery store ice-cream from the supermarket, and has never tasted, say, Haagen Dazs, then one wouldn't know the difference. Well ragazzi, it's time to taste the real mccoy...just have to drive a few minutes down the street where their gelato really does hit the "g-spot" (hehe!!)  :)

Non mangiate mai le schifezze, santa pace!!
