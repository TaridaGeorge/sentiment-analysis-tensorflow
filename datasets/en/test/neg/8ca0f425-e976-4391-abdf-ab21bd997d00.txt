Stay away! Tempe's horrible, abysmal attempt at imitating an upscale 'Scottsdale-esque' lounge. It's expensive, very cheap and the drinks are terrible! It always seems to attract the worse, most ghetto crowd as well. I have been twice and the second time there was a huge fight and they shut down the place early. I have also witnessed a fight outside the Lounge passing down Mill Ave.

Music is bad, drinks are bad and the crowd is even worse.
