oh man!  i couldn't agree more with sarah m. and emily w.!  wtf is right about this theater!?  babies crying, kids running around in the aisle while parents IGNORE this behavior, smelly people, bright, eye hurting cell phones...i could go on and on.

what give harkins?  why do you allow this to keep occurring?  

i will NEVER go back to this place and i will never have children!
