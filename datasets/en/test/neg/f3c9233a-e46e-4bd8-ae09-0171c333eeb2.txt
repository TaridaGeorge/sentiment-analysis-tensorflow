Completely let down! Looked forward to this event and invited friends and bummed we did. Too long of lines, parking was a mess, and some booths had you wait in line buy tickets then wait in another line to get your food, which was over priced and small portions. So terrible. Hate all the lines and HATE that we had to pay to come into this mess and pay to park. A complete joke! Take a tip: either twice as many trucks or limit your tickets. More alcohol stations and better music. Scale down prices if you're going to charge us to get in.
