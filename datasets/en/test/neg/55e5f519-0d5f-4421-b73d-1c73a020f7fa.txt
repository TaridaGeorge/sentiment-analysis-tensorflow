"Buy one get one free Whopper" Don't count on it at this location.  I ordered a couple of #1's here, and instead of breaking it down like the store on Olive, they just charge you for both.  Don't question them about it.  When they dane to answer you, you will  get a rude and surly answer similar to "If you weren't smart enough to order it that way, your loss"

This kind of customer service does not earn your money, no matter how hungry you are
