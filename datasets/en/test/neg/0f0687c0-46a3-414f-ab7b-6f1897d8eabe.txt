There is a reason countries like China are rising up. Because we're electing idiots like Jan Brewer. I mean, who cares if she was left as the caretaker Governor, but to re-elect her? One of our state's biggest blunder.

Her victory speech included bashing on the president and threatening to challenge the federal government. Hey, why not secede from the union at the same time? We're already allowing some highly unconstitutional stuff, like SB 1070. It wouldn't be too far fetched to think that Brewer might actually one day propose this insane idea. Pretty much the whole state wasn't against SB 1070, yet here we are, we voted her back in.

Then we go and vote in other republicans along with her. Great.
