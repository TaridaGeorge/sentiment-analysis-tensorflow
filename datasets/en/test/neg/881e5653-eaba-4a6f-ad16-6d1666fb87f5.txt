I wanted to ensure my hair was done right, so I bit the bullet and paid the high prices at Rolf's.  The last time I had my hair colored, I did NOT love it, but it was just OK.  This time, I've now spent a total of 6 hrs for the initial color and then the color correction.  My hair is bright orange.  I am absolutely mortified.  I was so upset and knew there was nothing more than could be done without my hair falling out of my head from all the chemicals, so I just said it was fine, paid the $300 bill, and left.  My friends said I shouldn't have paid 20 cents for what I got.  I can assure you I will never make this mistake again, will NEVER return to Rolf's, and I sure hope you don't either.
