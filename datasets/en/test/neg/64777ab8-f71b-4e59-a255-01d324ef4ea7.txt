I will never set foot in a building where my friends get assaulted. Every venue Snake! Snake! Snakes! has ever played will tell you they arrived on time, brought a good crowd and played a hell of a show. For them to be disrespected is one thing, and it would be enough of a reason for me to tell everyone I know to never put another cent into these people's pocket. But another line was crossed last night. I've played shows at a lot of the same venues as this great band, and I never would have thought any management anywhere would lay hands on the artists that bring business through their door. These guys deserve better than that. Phoenix, Arizona has always stood by Snakes! and we always will!
