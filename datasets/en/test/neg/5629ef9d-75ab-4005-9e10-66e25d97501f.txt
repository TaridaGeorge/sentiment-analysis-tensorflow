I wanted to talk with this gym about membership options, but due to a tight schedule, was only able to talk by phone. 

I was told that was impossible, and that if I wasn't "willing" to come to the gym for the hard sell, then I clearly wasn't committed enough to my fitness goals.

What a way to guarantee no-sale! It is nice to know right away that everyone is just a number, a body to them. If they treat me so poorly when they WANT my money, I can only imagine what the "service" is like once they've got it. 

No thanks, Gold's. I deserve better.
