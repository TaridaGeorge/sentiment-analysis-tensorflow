What a joke. We recently moved to this area of Phoenix and thought we would try it one night after seeing the sign that it was on the food network walking out of Sprout's. They charge $3 for bread and it is four small slices of stale french bread. The two pasta dishes had no real sauce or flavor and the prices are ridiculous. 

It was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's. Mamma Mia is similar in price but offers twice the portion and you get the bread for free like a normal Italian Diner. I think this might be the angriest I have ever been after eating dinner out.
