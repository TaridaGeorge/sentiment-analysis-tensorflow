First time and will never go back. The poor manicurist that I had it was her first day and the other employees weren't helpful to her to find the supplies and my tech had to keep getting up to find things. Does not seem to be a real good working atmosphere and I could certainly tell when I was there just a few minutes. There was no thank-you except from my poor tech and all the other employees treated me the same as the poor tech. 
I will never go back and would suggest to anyone else not to go.
