Had a nice day here until I came back at night and was accused of walking out on my tab earlier that same day. I closed out with my waitress in cash. I grabbed a manager and told him about the situation and I pointed out the waitress to him he then opened her book and she was pocketing all cash transactions. I then checked my bank and my card was ran for the bill I already paid in cash. I had to call my bank and have the transaction cancelled. I was not offered an apology nor was the waitressfired. I will never go to this place again.
