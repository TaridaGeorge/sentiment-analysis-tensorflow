This place gets worse and worse every time I come here- but it's the only drive thru donut shop in Queen Creek. Donuts are always cold. Drive thru service is ridiculously slow- and even the drive through configuration makes no sense. You literally have to do a loop-de-loop to: avoid cars coming out of the drivethrough and then go out the same shopping center driveway to get back on the road.  Are they taking advantage of their monopoly?  Because as soon as someone else shows up with even a little better service, DD will disappear.  To summarize some of my "best" visits: chocolate cake donut with chunk missing, shortchanged me.
