My son and I love frozen yogurt and U-Swirl had always been one of our favorites because of its good selection. When we went in yesterday it was a bit disheartening because the tattoo -headed man at the register seemed like he was doing us a favor ringing us up. No greeting,  thank you, smile or small talk. Thought maybe he was just  having a bad day until he went out of his way to be overly friendly to the single man he rang up next. Maybe they just dont like kids. Kind of sad for a yogurt shop though.
