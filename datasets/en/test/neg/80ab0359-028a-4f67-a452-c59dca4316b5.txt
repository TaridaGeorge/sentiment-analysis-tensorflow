Bad.
They made us sign our names and compared it with their drivers license,
and took pictures of us with a digital camera.
Accused us of a false ID. One of us got turned away because of an out of state drivers license.

One of our guys got turned away because one of us wasn't wearing dress shoes, but wearing Lacoste fancy looking tennis shoes.

Air is rotten.
Dancers aren't as good looking or skilled as other clubs.
the crowd is meh.

By far the crappiest club I have ever experienced.
