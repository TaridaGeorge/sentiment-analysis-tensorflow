When we first got here they had a big sign saying something like, please take a cookie upon check-in, but there was no cookies.  Everything in this hotel DATED....stains on everything including shower curtain, bedspreads, towels and carpets.   No towels at the pool.  Not worth it .....no matter what the price is.   The signage is horrible.  Try finding the roof deck pool.
