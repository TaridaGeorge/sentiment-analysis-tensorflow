Horrible job. I got a mani/pedi and I could have done a better job myself. I know sometimes they can accidently cut your skin, but she took a huge chunk out of my cuticle then tried telling me I had a hang nail.... um I think not idiot. The paint job was horrible... the whole nail wasn't even covered. Pricing was alright, service horrible.
