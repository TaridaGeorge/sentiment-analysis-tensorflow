I brought in my Saturn to check the a/c - it had stopped working, just blew out warm air.  They came back with a quote of $2000.  No joke.  The blue book on my car is $5000.  They said everything was shot; hoses, compressor, valves.  They said I needed a whole new a/c kit.  

A different shop, a different mechanic, and $350 later my a/c is working just fine and blowing ice cold air.

I would recommend you get a second opinion before letting this place work on your car.
