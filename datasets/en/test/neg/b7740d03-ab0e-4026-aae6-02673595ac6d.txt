I've been in here quite a few times and I've never found ANYTHING worth buying.
How the heck is this store still in business?
Their selection IS pretty outdated.
It's just so blah and the brands they use, I've seen em at cheap Asian stores. I mean they do have that blingy "boutique style" going on, but I mean it all just looks so generic. 

The store has potential, it has all the cute decor inside just like any other cutesy boutique.

Customer service?
there's not much of it.
All I've ever felt was just awkwardness while walking and browsing the store..

This store is just not for me.
