The first time I ate here last year I would have given them 5 stars, but tonight they got 1 star for the following reasons.

1. It took over an hour to get our appetizer and food.  Our appetizer came out only moments before our food.
2. It took another 45 mins to get our check and leave
3. The waiter barely touched our table

The only plus is that complaining to the manager is that we got our appetizer comped.

Needless to say we're never coming back.
