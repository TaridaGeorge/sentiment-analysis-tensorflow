Dear Tempe Marketplace,

This is the most upsetting place I can think of in my immediate vicinity. If I ever commit suicide, it will be here.

You really are an easy target, aren't you? 

Your "authentic" restaurants of every variety aren't fooling anyone.

Don't get me started on the unwalkable parking lot that I'm forced to traverse in order to hit Target and the Coffee Bean in the same trip. 

And for fuck's sake, stop playing '90s top 40 songs in the parking lot. At earsplitting levels. If I wanted to listen to Matchbox 20, I'd do it at home, alone, in total shame, like a normal person. 

Waste of space, waste of resources, waste of time.

But I'll totally be back next week when I need TP or want to see a movie, k? 

See you then!
Sara
