Called about a BEAM vacuum part...don't waste your time with them.  They said they would order the part but couldn't guarantee the color, etc., there supplier would send...I called again over two weeks later and they still hadn't placed an order with their parts supplier.  I got on line with a Central Vacuum Store and the part will be here in 3 days...less expensively I might add.  I had to select a star or I would have given a ZERO rating.
