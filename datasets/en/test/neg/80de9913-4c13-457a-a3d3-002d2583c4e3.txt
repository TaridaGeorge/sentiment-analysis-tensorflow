Went here based on all the great Yelp reviews.  I almost walked out of this place because it took forever to get my order in.  People kept calling this place, and instead of prioritizing who would get serve first, I guess take out took priority over people who were eating in.  When I finally did get my order in, the food came out fast, but the food was so bland and mediocre, I should have just left then and there, but why would I waste $13?  Anyways, should have tried someplace else.  Also, it was kinda of gross that the owner's daughter was hanging out on the table I was at, and left all here hairs on the plate, the napkins, etc.
