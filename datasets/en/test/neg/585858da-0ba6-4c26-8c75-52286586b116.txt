I think I just bought the worse sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. Aren't Quiznos subs supposed to be toasty? The bread is cold, the cheese is non-existent and as the other reviewer said, the tuna tastes like paste. Paste that has been sitting in a bucket for 4 days. And now you have to ask them for the toppings. I requested jalape√±os and banana peppers and I swear I got one of each.  I'm starving but not enough to even finish this sandwich. Should have gone the two extra miles to get to Potbelly's instead.
