I did not like this place.
The menudo was very poorly made, muddy and too spicy.
I also ordered the tacos de cabeza, they were GREASIER than heck, the meat was refried for some reason, and huge chunks of fat were found throughout the tacos.
I couldn't even finish ONE... the tortillas were actually good, if they wouldn't have been soaked in the grease from the meat.
I'm never going there again... if I need menudo (hang-over cure) I will get some Juanita's at the grocery store!

OH! and they charged my credit card twice! so now I guess I have to go back!
