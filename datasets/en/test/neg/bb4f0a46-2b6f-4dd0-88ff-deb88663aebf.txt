This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered:
Combo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada 
Green chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross.
Taco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter.
The beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans.
This place sux!
Beer is good.
