Quick 3 word review: Food Truck Fiasco

Longer review: This could have been good. There were many food trucks and tons of eager people wanting to taste their offerings. Only problem is the lines were so long, after waiting two hours in one line, yes, one line and I admit that sounds excessive. And it was. So bitter after getting our food and wasting the day, we left. I've been to other culinary festivals where you wait in line for a couple minutes, but this was ridiculous and all lines were the same. In the end, too many people made lines unbearable and the festival a failure.
