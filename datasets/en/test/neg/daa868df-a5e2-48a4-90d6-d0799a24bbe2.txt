I stayed here for one night because my usual hotel chain in this particular city was not pet friendly. I should have kept driving. Despite their insistence that they are "Inn of the Year" for 2011, this was the most uncomfortable hotel I think I've ever stayed at. The bed was more like sleeping on a rock. The air conditioner did not work well and the room stayed quite hot all evening. Even after driving for over 12 hours, I could not fall asleep in that dreadful bed. It made the next day of driving nearly unbearable. Kudos for being pet friendly, but the rooms need a serious upgrade.
