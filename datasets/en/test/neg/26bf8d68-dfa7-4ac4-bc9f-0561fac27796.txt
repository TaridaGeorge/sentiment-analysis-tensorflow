Very disappointed with this place. They do have many pretty things to purchase, but the customer service is terrible. I walked in and neither of the two associates greeted me. Two customers walked in right after me and they were both not only greeted but asked if they could be helped. When i walked out and right passed the sale associate there was again no acknowledgment. I was ready to make a purchase at this store but the customer service really made me reconsider.
