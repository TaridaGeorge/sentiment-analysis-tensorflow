I just moved from SF to Scottsdale and went to this gym to check it out. I met with a membership person by the name of khieser and all his only motive was to sell me a membership that day. He was a used car sales person working in a gym. I asked him to see if I could try the gym for a couple of days and he said no they don't do that. He lied... Later I checked on there website and they offer a 7 day free pass. Anyways horrible customer service.
