Unfortunately, this was the worst sushi I've ever had. The rolls and other pieces were edible, but the mackerel sashimi was simply unbearable, and I had the awful salty taste in my mouth for the rest of the day to remind me (a taste so pungent, it persisted even after having Mexican food for dinner). wow.
