I wish there was a zero star option because this DD location deserves it. I love their iced lattes, but no one at this location seems to know how to make one. It actually seems like none of the employees know the difference between an iced coffee and iced latte. It doesn't matter if I speak slowly or repeat my order 10x, they almost always get it wrong. Also, they can't figure out how to make their breakfast sandwiches. Because of these reasons I have vowed to never go back to this location! The location on rittenhouse in QC is much better.
