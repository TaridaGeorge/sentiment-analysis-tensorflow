Landed late. 

Frantically located a gate agent. 

Got laughed at. ("There is no way you will make that connection.") 

Sprinted to the ticket counter. 

Found out that in order to get to the next gate, I have to go to another terminal. This is a simple task in most other airports. Here it means exiting the airport, getting on a bus, reentering through the security checkpoint at the next terminal, and then sprinting full throttle to the wrong gate for the flight that I *just* missed because the sweet little old lady in the friendliest airport in America gave me the wrong directions and the security personnel spent five precious minutes chatting about their weekend plans with my belongings in their hands. 

What a cluster fuck. 

The free wi-fi came in handy for the three hours that I waited for the next flight.
