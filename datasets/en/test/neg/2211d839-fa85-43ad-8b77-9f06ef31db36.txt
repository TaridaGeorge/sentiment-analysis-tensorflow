My first experience with this place was on a friday afternoon for lunch. All my other friends had the lunch buffet and I ordered off the regular menu. My meal was a large portion and good value, but not even an hour after eating there I got very sick. Their chicken gave me food poisoning, I don't think I will be back soon, every time I drive by and see it I have bad memories.
