Watch out for thieves. The rented rafts get stolen if you look the other way, my sons shoes were stolen, the pretzels we bought to snack were stolen, even my sunscreen  was stolen right in front of my nose. Parents are just as trifling as bad kids, if you see your child is wearing someone else's shoes why do you allow and encourage that?  And how are you going to eat someones food? This is just nasty. I rather pay more and go to Wet and Wild instead and save myself from little criminals and their parents.
