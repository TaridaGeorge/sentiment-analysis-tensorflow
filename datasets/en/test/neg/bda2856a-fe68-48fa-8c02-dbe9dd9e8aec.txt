We came here last Friday night and I was excited because I dying to try it out. There were three girls sitting outside smoking as we walked up, and I asked if they were closed. She said no, but they were the only three in the club except for the bartenders. This was around 1:30am. Sure enough, we went inside and there was no one and the bartenders were shutting down for the night. Lame.
