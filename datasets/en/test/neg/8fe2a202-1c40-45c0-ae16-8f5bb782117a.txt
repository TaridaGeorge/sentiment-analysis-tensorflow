Probably  the worst food i have ever eaten...The guys in tent city eat better than this. Went to this restaurant on Tuesday  vomiting and diarrhea stopped on Thursday. Great place to go if you want to lose weight. Restaurant was filthy ,restrooms worse than filthy. I intentionally ate things that were not likely to give me food poisoning, salad, freshly cooked Mongolian BBQ. still ended up sick as dog. Quality of food and freshness were horrible  only ate a small amount because it was a family function 1 hr from home and I was starving. I hope those of you who gave this place a good review were getting paid to do so. DO NOT EAT HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
