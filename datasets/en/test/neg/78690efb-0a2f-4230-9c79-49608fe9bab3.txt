Tonight was my last time that I will be going there. New management changed the rules for happy hour. There is no longer a reverse happy hour and skyy drinks are now taken off the list. When I called and asked about the reverse happy hour, I was treated as if the question were insane to ask (when I had previously been there). Additionally, going during regular happy hour, my friend and I ordered strictly happy hour offerings and were not told that Skyy drinks were no longer on there. When we asked the manager why we were not previously informed, we were told they no longer give happy hour menus.
