Eek! methinks not is damn about right. Ordered the make your pasta item with chicken pesto and angellini pasta and the tiramisu. 

One of the worst Italian foods I have had and the chicken was definitely rancid (I am quite sure that it hadn't been stored at the right temperature and had been lying there collecting salmonella for quite some time).

The tiramisu was such a disappointment what happened to the layers of ladyfinger and the delicate touches of coffee.

This reminds me of the time I tried watching Gigli.

The only saving grace was the history of the owner(displayed on theor menu) who allegedly was a thief and a bum. Seems like he was known for making business fail. How ironically true....
