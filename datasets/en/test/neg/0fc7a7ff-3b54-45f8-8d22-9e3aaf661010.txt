If there was an option for no stars I would have given that. Everybody in here was rude today and just seemed like they had something better to do. I should have went next door to five guys. At least they like their customers. Between the first girl rolling her eyes at me and the cashier rushing us to pay, we sure didn't feel very welcome.
