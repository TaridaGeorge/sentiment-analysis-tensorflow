DO NOT USE THEM! I should have know better based on the other Yelp reviews.  I picked up my clothes and 3 pairs of slacks had damage to them. The damage was located in the same place on all 3 pairs.  I was told the owner would call me the next day to discuss. The owner never called. 6 days later, I called them.  The owner is nowhere to be found. I ended up speaking to the manager who was rude, disrespectful and couldn't care less about how she treats customers. They didn't care at all and told me there was nothing they would do. DO NOT GO TO THIS CLEANERS, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!
