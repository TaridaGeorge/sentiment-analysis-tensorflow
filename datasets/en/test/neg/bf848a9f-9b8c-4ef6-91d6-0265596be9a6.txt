In 2007, my BFF & I finally pulled into our beloved Tempe after driving for 16hrs from what felt like the other side of the world. We were exhausted, emotionally and physically taxed, and ravenous. Didn't want to go through a drive-thru. Like hell either one of us was cooking. So we hopped out for Panda Express takeaway.

I ate & went to bed. Got up a couple of hours later to fasten my head to the porcelain god for the entire rest of the night. I rang in my first sunrise back in AZ for 2007 purging my "meal" from the night previous through vomitous fanfare. 

I can't even go near one of these poor excuses for Chinese food now. Haven't touched it since. Did I gross you out? Don't blame me. Blame Panda.
