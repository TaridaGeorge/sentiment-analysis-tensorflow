I ordered from hunan Chinese delivery last night and was not impressed at all! I was so dissapointed when I opened it all up. I had gone on here to find a good delivery and this place had good reviews so I thought I'd try it out. 

The prices are good for what you all get but the quality of the food was terrible. The orange chicken was super soggy and so was the rice. I did enjoy the egg roll though. My husband ordered the teriyaki beef and didn't even want to touch it. He said looking at it just made him want to get sick. Def won't be eating the mounds of leftovers today...
