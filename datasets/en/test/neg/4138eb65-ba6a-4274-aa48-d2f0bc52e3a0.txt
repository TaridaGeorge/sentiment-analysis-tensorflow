This place sucked.  When you walked in it looked pretty nice, Lobby area was small but it was decent.  We asked for non smoking room and as soon as we entered our room we could smell the smoke.  Our "non smoking" seemed like an ash tray.  Cabinets were out of date, and one of the TV armoire door kept closing on me so I could only watch half the TV.  

The bathroom had mold in the shower tiles.  We tried using the hot tub and it was broken, lets not forget the "continental breakfast".  It looked like the storage room, and pretty nasty.  What else can I say, you get what you pay for right?
