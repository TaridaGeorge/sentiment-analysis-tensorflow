This review is for this location only.

Extremely disappointed. I went to get drive-thru the other day;  I ordered 2 drinks 2 harsh brown, 1 burrito and 2 sandwiches. The server confirmed the order and I corrected her when there was a mistake. I drove by the window and gave her my card. (not to mention her attitude). She handed me the a plain black coffee! (I asked for a Hazelnut Coffee with creme and sugar) Then I went home and took a look. 2 orders of harsh brown were missing. I like Dunkin Donut but I will never go back to this location again!
