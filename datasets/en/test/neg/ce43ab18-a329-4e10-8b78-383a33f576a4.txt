We were not greeted by anyone. And they weren't even busy. Some big bald guy was using vulgar language and talking about some girl he didn't like while cooking right in front of us.  My husband and I walked out and ended up getting mexican.  (And I really wanted some italian)  If a business lacks customer service, I most likely will not buy from them.

I did notice the great reviews on yelp, and I really wanted to try their food.  But I doubt I will be back.  To bad because I live near by.  If they keep getting good reviews, I just might try to go in again.
