I don't normally expect good service from a chinese retaurant unless you're at a chained restaurant like P.F. Chang's. But this place is the worst both food and service. The younger gentleman with glasses at the counter is really rude. I was recommended to this place by a friend who said it's the best Chinese go to for him since he always do a take out order. Recently a young gentleman at the register screwed up his order as well. 

Funny story was, I was talking to my boss about Chinese restaurant and he mentioned Iron Chef where he took his family. We ended up talking and find out we were treated the same way from the same guy. We laughed it off and made joke about it all the time now.
