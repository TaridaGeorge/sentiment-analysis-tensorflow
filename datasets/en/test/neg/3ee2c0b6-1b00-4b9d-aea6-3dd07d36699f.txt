What happened to Katie? A sign says under new management. Unfortunately the chemical smell (paint? acetone?) was so bad I couldn't stay. The only reason I gave one star was because I couldn't select zero. If the smell is an indication of the new mgmt's quality of service, I won't be back. Sad because Katie was awesome.
