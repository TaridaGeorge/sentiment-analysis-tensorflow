This Starbucks is okay.  I only come here because its the only one on my way to work.  Their staff can be rude and unfriendly, they make you feel like you're not as important as the other customers are their friends are they know.  I think I'm going to have to find another Starbucks even if that means I have to go out of my way....  ::(
