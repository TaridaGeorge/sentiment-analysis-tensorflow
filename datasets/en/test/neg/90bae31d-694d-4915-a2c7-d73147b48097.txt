i went here this past Saturday and the place was packed. I went to the bartender to get some drinks and ordered some jello shots (15) to be exact. The bartender starts handing them to me and I asked if someone could take them to the patio for us. He belligerently said he wouldn't and passed me off to an even ruder server who totally rolled her eyes!! Too bad b/c me and my crew love to drink......and tip well. Don't these people work for tips. But I guess I forget it was Mill and most  of them are probably college students - good luck paying for it! HA!
