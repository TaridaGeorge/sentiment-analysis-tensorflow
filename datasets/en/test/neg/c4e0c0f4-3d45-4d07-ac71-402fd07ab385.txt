Looked up Leonidas on their website and was excited to see a menu for their cafe.  It listed how in addition to all of their chocolates, it also listed "pastries" and specifically multiple cheesecake choices.  We go down.....no cheesecakes or pastries of any kind!  Young girl working says the owner only has those out on the weekend!  Wasted trip.
