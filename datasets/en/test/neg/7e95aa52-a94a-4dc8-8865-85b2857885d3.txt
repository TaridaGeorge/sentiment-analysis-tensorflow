II just left there after the most disappointing pedicure ever.  On the plus side was lota of OPI polish to choose from and there was no wait on a Sunday afternoon.  But now I can see why.  The chairs are very dated.  It was uncomfortable, couldn't adjust the recline and could barely feel the massage.  The tech said nothing except to say how tired she was and that she had 2 1/2 more hours to work.  The mostly one handed massage she gave me was quick and lackluster at best.  She dropped the polish which broke all over the floor.  She failed to put something to separate my toes which resulted in smudging.  I had to ask for her to put cotton between my toes and after she did she didnt fix the smudge.  I will not be returning.
