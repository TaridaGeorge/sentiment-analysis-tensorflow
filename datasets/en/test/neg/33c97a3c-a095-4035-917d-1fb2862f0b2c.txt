Sat down and first thing I notices was price. Embarrassed to walk out I gave it a try to see If any good. Ordered a margarita pizza for it was cheapest. What I got was a cheese sprinkled with basil and that was it.  I questioned that this was not a margarita and all the said was this is the way they make it.  Should change name on menu. 

At any rate the pizza was plain and a little dry.  Also there was no wood oven taste.  Overall we paid before tip $35 for a 12 inch pepperoni and a 12 inch margarita. Two cokes cost $7.  Not worth it and was not very good.
