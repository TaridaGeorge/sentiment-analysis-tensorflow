I opened a yelp account so I could write this review.   
Monday afternoon, looking for a fun date lunch with my wife (vary rare).  Our server is around our sons age. 
Worst service ever!  Told manager on duty who must be friends with server and she was rude as all get out!   
We left never to return.
