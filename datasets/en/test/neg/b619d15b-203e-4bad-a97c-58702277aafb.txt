I tried XO Nails because it was so close to my house, but the disgustingly dirty floors should have been my first indication that it wouldn't be the best manicure I'd ever recieve.

I asked for the gel nails and they barely cleaned up my cuticles and used the same tools they used on a client before me. They were extremely sloppy with the polish and didn't clean up the excess gel surrounding my nails. This is a pet peeve, especially with gels because of how it dries. Three days later, the polish is already peeling off...unlike other salons I've been to where my gels stay on for 2-3 weeks.

Needless to say, I'm never going back.
