Sad place for a cheese steak. Back when they first opened they were pretty decent, now this place is a joke. Also when ordering over the phone they place you on hold for 10 minutes before they decide to assist you in placing your order. The hold tone is silence with a loud beep every 5 seconds it's maddening. There delivery range is LAME and there food is soggy and has no flavor..... This place is a JOKE
