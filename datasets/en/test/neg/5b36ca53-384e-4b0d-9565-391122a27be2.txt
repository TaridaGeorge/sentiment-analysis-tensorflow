This had to be the worst Sonic I have ever been to! I got food poisoning and the staff was very rude. They took about 10 minutes to even take my order. When they brought me my food I mentioned to them that their sign said if they do not try to up sell an order I get $2 off my next visit. They stated that they did try to up sell. I was not going to argue over a stupid $2 as the server was trying to but I did mention to him that the cashier did not up sell to anyone and I could hear their orders as well. This place was terrible, has bad service and food. I do not agree with false advertisements and rude service.  I love Sonic and I will not be returning to this one.
