I was so excited about their anniversary 50% off deal but I didn't realize they'd only do a 50 % job. They did a horrible job! They left watermarks all over my car. And my seats weren't even cleaned nor dry BUT they sure did remembered to clean out my middle console and STOLE all my change about 5 bucks worth. Im NEVER going back there again!
