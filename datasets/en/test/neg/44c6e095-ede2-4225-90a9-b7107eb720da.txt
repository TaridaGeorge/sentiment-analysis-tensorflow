I called for delivery to the Holiday Inn, less than a mile away, and the girl on the phone was either stoned or stupid. I repeated my phone number 3 times and she couldn't get it right. I told her I was staying at the HI and she asked for the address so I gave it to her. Then she asks if this is an apartment complex? WTF?!?! NO, IT'S THE HOLIDAY INN!!! Then she wants to know the cross streets and I tell her how the hell would I know I'm staying at the HI, I'm not a local. They can't deliver without knowing the cross streets.... blahblbhalalhalha! I hung up. Get a new phone person!!!
