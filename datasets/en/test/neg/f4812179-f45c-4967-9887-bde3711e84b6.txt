I'm not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me, Matt.
