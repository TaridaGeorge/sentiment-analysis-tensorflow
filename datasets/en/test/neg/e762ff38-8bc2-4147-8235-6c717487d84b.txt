The folks working at this place have that inner city "charm."  Except when they act like they were pulled off the streets, unbathed and ready to make your sandwich.  You have to fight for the flea's attention span of the guy who's taking your order over his shouts to his friends outside, the television, and the other people working with him.  
The cheese-steak  wasn't that bad, although my cold fries were covered with lukewarm cheez wiz.... nasty.

This place is nothing like the location in phoenix.  It's like the diry little brother of the phoenix location.

Thumbs down.
