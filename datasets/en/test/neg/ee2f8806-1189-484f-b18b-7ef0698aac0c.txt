Co-workers convinced me to go here for the Happy Hour special of $1 draft beers.  It was empty on a Friday, and didn't even pick up by the time we left at 8pm.  

You would think that with us being the only customers in the bar that the barkeep would be all over us to pump us full of booze and get some cash, this was not the case.  One of our own had to keep going back and forth to get us more beer.  She was also the one that was overcharged for her $1 beers too.  

This is the poor man's Cracker Barrell.  You know what you are going to get, there is no surprise, but you might want to look for a better option for booze and a steak.
