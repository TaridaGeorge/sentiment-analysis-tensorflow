A Nightmare!

Dealing with Jeff Hanson was truly a disaster. He was the most rude and unprofessional person I have ever dealt with. I would caution everyone before doing business with these people. They will lose your order and what they don't lose, they will screw up. And then they will not take any responsibility whatsoever! This was a terrible experience. I do not recommend doing business with Arcadia Window & Door and especially with Jeff Hanson.
