I just saw this on Undercover Boss and am shocked at how the owner has the gall to say he thinks his establishment is classy. He employes WHORES!  A few months ago, one of the waitresses came on to my husband and even handed him her business card with her name Lauren with XXX circled with a heart. The waitresses are dressed in bras with their boobs almost completely hanging out and the skimpiest little skirts - I wouldn't even call them skirts. It is a whoring establishment, with a restaurant/bar front. The waitresses are not at all professional. I am thoroughly and totally disgusted, especially after the owner goes on national TV pretending that his pick up bars with scantily clad girls are professional restaurant establishments. They are not. They are far from it. Start with the costume.  It covers almost nothing.
