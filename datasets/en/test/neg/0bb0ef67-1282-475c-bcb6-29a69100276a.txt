Just passing through town,stopped in to get a pedicure and got the women from hell with a bad attitude.  down right rude customer service skills. don't have her redo anything cause she will get mean and nasty with you. it was just one lady here who was the rotten apple, wish I could remember her name.but the other people that work there know who she is.. should have gone to Valley Nails in Mesa that was recommend by a lady from the hotel.
