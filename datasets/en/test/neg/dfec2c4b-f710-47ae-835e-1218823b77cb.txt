I will not choose to go back to this place. I had a martini, it was ok, other people had the suishi, again they said it was 'ok.' Mostly the customer service here is AWFUL! Don't go in with a group, they force everyone at a table to be one 1 ticket. THEY WILL NOT SPLIT A TICKET! WILL NOT! I even talked to a manager and they refused to do this. I felt like I was imposing on them for bringing them business. Don't go here. There are plenty of good suishi places around that will actually appreciate you business. Don't do it.
