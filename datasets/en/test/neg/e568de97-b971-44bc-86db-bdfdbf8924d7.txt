Decided to give this place another try.  My husband and I had dinner here after they first opened, we went again this week. Both times the food was horrible. The interior is clean, the staff friendly, the patio could definitely use some attention but you just cannot get past the food. I also noticed that some of their wine was bad (the waitress went through several bottles before finding a good one) and they don't seem to be keeping all their wine/beer in stock as some of it was unavailable after ordering off the menu.  Overall, I give it a thumbs down based on the taste and quality of the food alone.
