I have  come here time and time again trying to find something to like about making the semi-special trip here. I wish I could. I do not think my expectations are all that high, but maybe I am off base. 

They do make a decent latte, but... my driving force coming here were their mini-cakes/cupcakes which are no longer offered. With the change in bakers, they still do offere the tart but not the cupcake. I do not understand but I suppose it is not my place to. Thoes cupcakes had a delicious sweetness that my tummy craved on a regular basis. No luck in getting them anymore. I will stick to my usual (yes, local)  coffee house which does not require a special trip for much of the same.
