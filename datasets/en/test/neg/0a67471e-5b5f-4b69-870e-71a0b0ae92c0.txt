I was there too and heard this garbage. It was me and my wife's first time there. The food was mediocre at best. But what made me lose my appetite was the owner going on some idiotic tirade of why Canada was better than the US. I go to a restaurant to eat and enjoy myself, not to listen to some Asian douche bag who probably drives some suped up Tokyo Drift Subaru go on a rant of why a country that most people forget even exists is better than ours. What a tool...eh.
