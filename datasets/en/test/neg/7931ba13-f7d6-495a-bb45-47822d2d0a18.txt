Stay away.

They try to charge extra on repairs, a bunch of thieves.  I had rear brake problem, they called me over the phone w/ quote.  Their quote was little high, but I said go ahead.   When I went to pay they said they also needed 20 bucks for "shop supplies" this is bogus.   

Then they tried to add another 30 bucks.  I asked to see the bill - they cash register dude got real quiet - then quoted me the actual price.

Go to Walmart for oil change and they will replace my air filter for 15 bucks.

Go this place they charge 70 bucks.

Seriously, don't go.
