Wow...this was pretty bad. I mean almost everything was bad. The only saving graces were the bread and the iced tea. We both ordered combo platters with different things...brisket, chicken, pork. The brisket was bland. The chicken was dry. The pork was dry. Plus, if you are going to be a barbecue restaurant you should have a pretty outstanding sauce. Theirs is NOT that.
