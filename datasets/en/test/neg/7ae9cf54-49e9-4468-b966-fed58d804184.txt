Absolutely no customer service... Everyone there is miserable with the exception of 2 bellman who drove us to and from our destinations. I requested a fridge before we got there; wasn't in the room when we got there so I called the frog desk and was told, "i will send it right up"... An hour later, no fridge. Called again and told them we were leaving for dinner so they could come in the room while we were gone...2 hours later? No fridge. Seriously?? The bed was hard, we were only "allowed" 2 pool towels while we were there, the shower head sucked, and the AC BARELY worked which the front desk didn't care about either. Thank goodness we didn't pay full price! Oh and although the breakfast buffet was delish, our "waiter" was an ass. The busboy was more helpful. Never again!
