I try and I try and I try to like this place but the only thing Fleming's does consistently is let me down!  Simply said... our shrimp appetizers came out sans deveining.  Yes, the digestive track of the shrimp were right there for us to see.  Next, my veal chop came out raw.  RAW!  Cold and uncooked in the center.  I sent it back twice, and finally just gave up.  Amateur hour again.

To their defense, I had an amazing steak at the Dayton, Ohio location.  But at least four other locations have let me down.  Sigh...
