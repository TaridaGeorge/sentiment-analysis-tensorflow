The Dr's seem okay but their billing department and office department is atrocious to say the least.  They will bill you for things that were already paid and then will continue to harass you to pay it and continue to increase it and add lots of $ on to it.  This is after you have already paid your bill in full during the appointment.  They will change the amounts and threaten and they will not discuss things reasonably.  They will just insist that you pay for their office/clerical errors.  Read the reviews on other sites from past employees and you will hear the same thing from past employees as well as patients.  I wouldn't trust either location just based on their billing practices alone.
