Are you freaking serious? If I could rank below 1 star it would be awesome to be honest!
My friend and I went there for lunch. It was our first time having lunch over there. Right when we walked in expecting to get a decent service but we ended up disappointed.
Service was EXTREMELY suck, food was OMG so damn awful! My friend ordered Orange chix and I ordered Beef Chowmein. But you know what seriously I would go for Panda Express for the same price but so much better quality!
Note to self never ever come back again, oh and I forgot to mention their boba taste worse than overdue milk!
