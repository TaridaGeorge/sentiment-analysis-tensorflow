I can't conjure up a worthy adjective to  the degree of disappointment I experienced at this restaurant. We were drawn in by reviews telling of some of Phoenix's "finest Italian dining", and were excited at the possibility of a new discovery.

Whomever reviewed this restaurant and gave it more than a "yuck" must have it confused with someplace else; the setting was dark and gloomy, the service  appalling, and the food would probably have been better if they had gone to Safeway's deli counter and reheated it in the microwave. 

We feel obliged to warn people about this terrible place.  Do yourselves a favor, and go elsewhere.
