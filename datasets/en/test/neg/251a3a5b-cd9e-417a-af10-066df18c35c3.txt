Boo! Made an appt for 2 on a Saturday for an oil change. Showed up on time....still sitting here 2 hours later watching them just now begin the oil change. They used to be ok, but have gotten real bad real quick. Nowdays they take forever and are always trying to upsell additional services. I don't feel the their assesments are trust worthy. Will not be back.
