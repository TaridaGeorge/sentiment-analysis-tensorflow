Only one star based on having to at least have one!

Long wait for main course

Ahi tuna was not good- fat strands throughout 

Sea bass too expensive for the dish - just average

Waiter recommended the pineapple upside down cake- worst desert we ever had!  Didn't taste like the desert we have had many times!  Saturated in brown sugar rich sauce.

Will never go there again, we a recommendation from the Westin.  They will receive a review as well.
