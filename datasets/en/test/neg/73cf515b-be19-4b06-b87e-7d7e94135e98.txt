I've given Famous Ray's two chances (another location had raised my hopes), and both times I've walked away nonplussed. 

The pizza is especially greasy. The sauce and crust are okay, but the cheese is synthetic and the toppings are either old or low-quality... they just didn't add any flavor. 

The cashiers I've had have both done their job of handing me my pizza and ringing me up, but neither looked like they planned on being at the job tomorrow. I didn't dare peek at the chefs. 

The store itself was what you'd expect from a take-out pizza dive. Flourescent lighting, poorly cleaned, totally unappetizing.
