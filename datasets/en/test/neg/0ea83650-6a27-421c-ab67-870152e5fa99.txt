I regrettably  took my little one to Sonoma for lunch. Their advertising suggests the use of fresh ingredients, but much to my and my kid's dismay, this was not the case. We ordered the penne alfredo off the kid's menu and it was not edible. There was so much garlic powder in the sauce that you could not taste anything else and it burned our mouths. I love garlic, but this was terrible. Needless to say, once we got our food, the waiter ignored us, despite the fact that the restaurant was empty at the time. When I finally got his attention, asked for the check and mentioned the problem, there were no apologies, just, "Yeah I can smell the garlic." I was charged for the uneaten meal. 
BTW, since when is garlic powder a fresh ingredient?
