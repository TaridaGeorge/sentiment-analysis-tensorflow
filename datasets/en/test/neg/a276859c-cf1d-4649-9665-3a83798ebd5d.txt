Please people, wise-up.  These Sandwiches are awful.  Cheap Italian cold cuts on a big hotdog roll do not make a Sub sandwich.  

First, the meats are pre-sliced and of very poor quality. 

The vegatables have been in the bin too long with brown bits in the lettuce and tomatoes that were sliced while George W. was still prez.  

And people, that is a hotdog roll, not a sub roll.  No structure, no body.  

Look at the pretty signs over the counter, now look at the sandwich that you are about to eat.  Do they look the same?  

Well, you got what you paid for, and you didn't pay much.  

I swear, some people eat for the fuel, not for the taste or quality of what they shove down thier cakehole.
