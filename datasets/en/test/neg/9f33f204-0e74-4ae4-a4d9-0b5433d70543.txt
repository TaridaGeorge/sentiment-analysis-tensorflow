This place has the absolute worse cookies I have ever eaten and they are small cookies at $3 each.  Don't get the raspberry one as it tastes like you are eating a hibiscus flower. Yuck!  I was sick all day after eating 1 bite. The place is extremely pricey especially for lunch. A very sad little restaurant that one should avoid.
