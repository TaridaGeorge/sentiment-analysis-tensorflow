The customer service here was absolutely horrendous. I was in a party of 6 and was told it would be 30-40 minutes to be seated. After checking back in with the hostess 4 or 5 times, it ended up taking over 2 hours to be seated. Apparently, the hostess was unaware that even though the 6-person tables were occupied, 6 people could be seated by placing together any of the unused 4 person tables with any of the unused 2-person tables. By the time we were seated, half the restaurant was empty but there was a large contingent of angry people still waiting to be seated. Additionally, the waitress was terrible, offered nothing to compensate for the long wait, screwed up our order, and argued with someone at our table regarding what she ordered. The food was good, but I'll never go back.
