really? 4 stars? how? why? is it because i am Chinese or cus i am from California?

food wasn't 'hot', it was warm but not hot... their famous potstickers were dry... soup was tasteless... lots dishes we ordered were too salty... 

good decor though and the service was ok... but food.. i am a eater and i almost came out of this place ANGRY!! we were a group of 15 and were grabbing a quick bite before going to the airport... if i knew there was a ruby tuesday on the other side of the hotel... i would NOT have come here!
