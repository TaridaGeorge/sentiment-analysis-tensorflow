Cool space, excellent servers but the food was not good.  I had the chicken caesar wrap.  There was bones other unknown chicken parts in the sandwich.  It was tasteless.  My wife had the chicken bbq sandwich and I tried that and it was unremarkable aka bleh.  We ordered plain mashed potatoes for our 1-year old and she seemed to like it.  I tried a bite, I mean sip of that and it was softer than soup.  Hopefully they hire a consulting chef and get things right cause I would love to see this space make it.  There are so many greater options in the area, that I really don't see myself going back.
