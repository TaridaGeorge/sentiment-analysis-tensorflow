WAY too expensive for what you get.

It may be one of the only places in Tempe that uses the authentic "wiz", however I don't want to pay for the novelty when I can get a better sandwich for $3 less at The Munchies Cafe on 6th and Mill.  

Corleones offers other cheeses than the "wiz", and when I ordered my sandwich with provolone they didn't give me any crap about it.  That doesnt mean it was good.  The sandwich was almost $10, and it wasn't very big.
