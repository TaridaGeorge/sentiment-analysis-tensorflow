HOTEL REVIEW: 
My experience and my opinion: Horrible customer service and staff. No apologies for the TONS of things that went wrong. A simple "we're sorry" would have gone a long way. For some reason, there was never a manager working when you needed one. 
Staff was very snoty-- from the shuttle driver, to front desk to security.
