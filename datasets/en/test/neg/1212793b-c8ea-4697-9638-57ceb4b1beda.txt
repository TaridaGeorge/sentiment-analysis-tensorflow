Avoid like the plague!

Terrible people rip-off scam, they sign you up after a Groupon offering great value, carry on charging you when your not even in the country, I have since left the US and explained my situation to the Manager -- who then decides to send a conned contract to a debt collection agency. 

AVOID - DO NOT deal with this company!!
