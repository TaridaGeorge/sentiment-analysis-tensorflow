I go to this place fiening for pizza on my walk back to my house every saturday night. Everyime i go there i end up full of rage wanting to take out the owner for the lack of customer service and anyone that gives him business.   I am usually too wasted to give a fluck but tonight i have had enough.  I beg everyone who reads this to never go to this place and tell everyone they know to tell everyone they know to never go here. 2:30 and no pizza ready and you are yelling at the people trying to give you business? GTFOH im going to philly cheesesteak company or ordering silvermine subs. gdmnt so pssed fuk u BOI!!!!!!!
