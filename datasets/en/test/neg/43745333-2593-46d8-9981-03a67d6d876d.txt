since high school, I had completed my own taxes but in the spring of 2010 I had Metz & Assoc. complete my 2009 return and although the final price was significantly higher than what was quoted to me at my consultation, I returned again this year to have them prepare my 2010 taxes.
After I had paid the bill of $690, I was provided with a copy of my return on which I found several errors.  After the exchange of several emails, I received this from Mr. John Metz "In the interest of getting this finished, we will give you draft copies of your tax return...and complete the return for an additional $200 as long as you don't come back..."
I agreed to those terms and the very next day I received my final bill...for $300.
