I love Flos and I can eat here few times a week. well I was picking up somebody at the airport and it was around lunch time, so i figure I will have my dose of Flo's. Wow what a disappointment. The food was AWFUL, i could not even eat and I will never go there again, I got Rice with the Mongolian beef with Broccoli, "Ye-ks". Flo, PLEASE close this place down because this is not a good representation of your hard work. 

Dont waste your money on this location. I will go to Flos on FLW and Thompson Peak any day. I love it.
