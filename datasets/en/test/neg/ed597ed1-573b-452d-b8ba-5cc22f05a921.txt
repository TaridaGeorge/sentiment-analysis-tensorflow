Went on a Friday around 4 in the afternoon and it was all but empty. Some happy hour. Anyway, the Mongolian beef may have actually been horse meat, maybe rabbit. It was nothing I've ever tasted , but definitely not beef.  The appotizers were the kind you buy frozen and drop in the deep frier, and even for that genr√© they sucked. 
Oh, and it was dirty. The table clothes had stains from their crappy sweet and sour sauce all over them. 
I am always looking for good Chinese - I didn't find any here.
