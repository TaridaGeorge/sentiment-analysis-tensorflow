I have been told by many that Flo's is the PLACE to go for GREAT Chinese food...

Unless we went to the wrong Flo's, this place was not impressive at all.

After waiting ten minutes before a food server actually acknowledged us, we were almost ready to get up and leave. It was a young gal who had no clue about anything on the menu...was this the food server or a random customer wandering the restaurant, I wonder?

 The soup was good, but not memorable enough for me to come back for more...

The portions? Um, what portions? They were so small...did we order from the kid's menu by mistake? Geez!

Small portions, poor service, ok food...we definitely WON'T be back!
