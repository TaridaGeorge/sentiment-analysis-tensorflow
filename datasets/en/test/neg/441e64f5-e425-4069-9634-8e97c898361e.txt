Very disappointed in my first experience. My husband and I were seated and 10 minutes later we were still not served, while 2 more couples that came in after us  were seated AND served. Since we were hungry,  we walked out without being served. I was looking forward to trying the banana split pancakes. So much for service. And there were two male servers wearing green tshirts and a female wearing an orange tshirt that served other couples that came in after us. The female one in particular kept glancing at us and walking by but never acknowleging us. We won't be back.
