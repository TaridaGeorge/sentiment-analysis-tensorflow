It was the service, not the food that was terrible.     

I ate at the bar, as I frequently do.    The server could not have been less interested in me.     Asked for my drink order as she was sprinting away...took my meal order as she was sprinting away again....neglected to give me a set-up (napkin, knife, fork) so I had to filch one from a nearby table...failed to notice my empty glass.

And gave me the wrong order.    As she later explained,  she simply didn't listen.     

The "right" order eventually came... but not the way I had ordered it.     

OK, they did comp me on the meal.     And she did apologize....sort of.     But I had to wonder if the mix-up was due to the fact that I was the lone female diner in a steady stream of males.      So, ladies, forewarned  is forarmed.
