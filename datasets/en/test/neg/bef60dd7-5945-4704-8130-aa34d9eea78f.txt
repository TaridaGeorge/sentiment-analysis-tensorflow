WORST SUBWAY EVER. When trying to add my vegetables, the guy helping was incredibly rude and looked annoyed that he was there. And then when I asked for my sandwich wrapped in separate halves, he said nothing and huffed and puffed as he wrapped. He acted like i was ruining his day. So rude and unprofessional. I will NEVER come to this Subway again.
