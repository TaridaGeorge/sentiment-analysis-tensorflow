Wow.  Because of this review, Piece of Cake Desserts have become somewhat defensive.  Very Polite, but defensive.  I've already received two follow up emails from the owners.  

I'm sure it was the 'too busy for your business' , with no other reason that was a bit off-putting.  

Maybe the situation and referral could have been handled better.  Instead of, 'we're too busy for your business, call so-and-so'.  Maybe this would have worked;  'Hello, my name is so-and-so from so-and so bakery, we helping Piece of Cakes Desserts through the Fathers Day weekend rush.  We would be more than happy to talk about making a cake for your special occasion'.  Hey, Just an example. 

So, water..bridge, as they say.  And on to the next thing!
