This review is only for the food and drinks on the patio.  The view is beautiful!  But the food and drinks were lame.  

I used to work here in the late 80's and the kitchen was so filthy that I swore I would never eat there again (food was good back then) - I can tell you stories!

This past weekend we were at the Renaissance Festival and since my mom lives near the resort  we thought we would give it a try on the way to her house. I don't know if the kitchen is clean (one would hope) but the food quality is definitely poor.
