We have been going to this location for over 2 years. Last Saturday (9/15/12) after our return from our summer place we looked forward to going to our favorite Chinese restaurant. We were disappointed to not see the familiar staff but were hopeful they were just off for that evening. 
We were seated and ordered the pot stickers, tea and Diet coke. Then we were given the menus and after 15 minutes someone asked for our order we then ordered the shrimp egg foo young. The staff seemed totally disorganized.
Our pot stickers never arrived and the shrimp egg foo young was hardly edible. 
We are now searching Yelp for another Chinese restaurant as we will not be back to China King. What has happened to this former favorite of ours????
