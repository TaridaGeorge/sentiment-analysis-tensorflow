I call shenanigans! We went in with a restaurant.com gift certificate, and they refused to honor it. They had an 8 1/2 x 11 inch piece of paper in the door saying now that they had changed their name from Rome's Pizza & Wings to Rome's Pizza, or something to that effect, they were not honoring restaurant.com gift certificates. 

Same owners,they just decided to be sleazy. They were rude and defensive when we asked about using the restaurant.com gift certificate. 

Atmosphere is the exact opposite of warm & inviting. It had all the charm of a Texaco in Gila Bend. Looked kinda like an old Burger King with fluorescent lighting & hard booths.

After the rude reception, we booked it out of there. Too bad too, I would have been a regular customer, cause they are close to home, if they hadn't been so shady & rude.
