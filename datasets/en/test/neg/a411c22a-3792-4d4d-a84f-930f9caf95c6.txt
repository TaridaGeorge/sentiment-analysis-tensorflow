I recently had a terrible experience at the Bevmo on I-10 & Ray. I ordered a keg of premium beer for a 40th birthday & the transaction went fine. But when I went to use it, the keg put out foam all night! I did everything I was supposed to do from keeping it cold to tapping it correctly. We ended up going to Fry's and just buying beer for the party! When I returned the keg & explained the issues nobody cared. I spent over $180 on this keg. They said they'll check it with the company they get it from & see if it was bad & the manager would call me back...still waiting...I will never shop at Bevmo again after getting no compassion or a call back! Stay away from this store!
