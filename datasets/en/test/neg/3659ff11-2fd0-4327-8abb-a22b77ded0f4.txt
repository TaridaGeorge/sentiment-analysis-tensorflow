I went there with my friend who really likes it.  I ordered  an $8.50 Reuben that had three wafer-thin slices of corned beef wadded into a ball in the middle to provide the illusion that there was some beef on the sandwich.  I pointed this out to my not-so-friendly server when she queried my satisfaction with the meal.  She said, in a snotty put-upon voice, "Well, we weight the meat for every sandwich!  Every sandwich gets four ounces!"  It was clear this one was way under and when I pointed this out she said, "do you want more meat?"  I asked if I was going to be charged - she said "Yes!"  I said no thanks and now my mission is to dissuade anyone who cares from ever going to this place.
