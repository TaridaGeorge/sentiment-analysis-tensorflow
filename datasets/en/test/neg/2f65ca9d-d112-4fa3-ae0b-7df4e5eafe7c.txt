Eeeewwww.

Eeeewwww. Super gross. Why would I EVER subject my body to wearing clothing or shoes that have been kicked around several times and are, essentially, in their final resting place?!
Do yourself a favor.....pay full price at a moderately priced store instead of this joke of a flea market. The labels may not say "high fashion runway" when purchased at the local mall stores, but they are decidedly more sanitary than the threads lining this dungeon.
