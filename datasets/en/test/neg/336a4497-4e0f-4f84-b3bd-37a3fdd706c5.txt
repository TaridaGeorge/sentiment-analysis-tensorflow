Soooo unorganized. Don't think any coach is over the age of 18.  Not sure there is any kind of plan for classes.  Tried a month of cheer leading classes. It was taught by a group of 3 or 4 teenagers mostly huddling together after every stance to try & come up with something for the kids work on next. One class was 20 min of stretching (for a 50 min class).  Another class the kids were sent on 5 diffrent water breaks to eat up some time.  The third class we showed up for,as usual at 4:30, & was told class time had been moved up to 4:00?  We were never notified so my daughter got 20 whole mins out of that class!
