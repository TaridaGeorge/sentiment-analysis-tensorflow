Ridiculous. I went to meet up with people. The guys at the top of the stairs let me in because I didn't have cash. My boyfriend found cash and paid anyways for both of us. We went down the stairs to enter the place and our friends walked out. We promptly walked back up the stairs and asked for a refund since we didn't go in the building. The employees collecting fees said no. They were rude and uncaring. I asked for the manager and they laughed. Talk about a rip off. Never going back, never recommending this place, and never saying good things about it.
