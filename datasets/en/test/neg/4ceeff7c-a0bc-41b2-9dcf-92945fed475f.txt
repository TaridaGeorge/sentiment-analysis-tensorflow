I don't get the Whiz. Repulsive. I have never had a Philly cheese steak from Philly... I pray this isn't really what they are supposed to taste like. 

Being a Chicago Italian, I can say that these people should be ashamed at the Italian beef they sell. Gross. Greasy and some funky flavors that do not belong in Italian beef.

Oh, and the obnoxious NYer persona was cute, almost endearing, back in the 80's and 90's. Now?... it's just obnoxious NYer. Get over yourself.

And it's 'Paisan'... not 'Piazan', you idiota!
