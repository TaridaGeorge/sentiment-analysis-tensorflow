The lady that did my nails did a HORRIBLE JOB!  I forget her name but it wasnt tammy and it wasn't Michael- they we're unevenly shaped- lifted really fast, she was putting them crooked then i mentioned it to her and was like oh yeah- i hated them.  i might go back but have the owner Michael do them.
