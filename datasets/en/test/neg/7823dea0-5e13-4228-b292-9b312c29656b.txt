My review is basically a repeat of the others. I got a LivingSocial deal as a gift from a friend, and had a bad experience. They cancelled my first appointment at the last minute due to an emergency, which I totally understand. Then the second appointment they were late for, which I also understand, you never know when someone hits traffic or whatever, so that's fine. However, they were supposed to clean for 2 hours and they only cleaned for 1, and they didn't move a single piece of furniture in the house to clean behind it. They rushed out of the house so quickly that the floors were still wet when they peeled out. Very unprofessional, I would not recommend them.
