well, where do I begin...my move from phoenix to chicago took place on april 16 and they lost 3 of my very expensive bikes along the way. Ill finish my review once they actually get back to us with the "extra" insurance we paid for to cover for replacement. Oh and by the way today is may 4....and they have not called us once. We keep calling and getting the run around. My finished review will take place after we see how they take care of our stolen bike issue.
