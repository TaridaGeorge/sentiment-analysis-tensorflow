it only has a few rides. the park is old and needs to be redone. there are no rides for kids which is a big issue for me. the bathrooms are so disgusting its pathetic. to much chaos. nay as well take the time to go somewhere better. i think its over priced for the little that they do have. it should only cost five dollars for locals.
