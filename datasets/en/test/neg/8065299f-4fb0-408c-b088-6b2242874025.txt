Place is terrible. Took 45 minutes to get a breakfast bagel and a cup of soup with a bialy. The soup was wrong and our waitress informed me that "that's the soup of the day, they don't go by the menu". Uh, then what's the point of listing the soup of the day for each day of the week on the menu? The soup tasted like flour and nothing else.  The bialy looked like a breadstick. I told the waitress I ordered the bialy, not the bialy stick(also a menu item). I was told that's what their bialys look like. I don't know what bagels and bialys these owners tried in new york, but if they tasted anything like these bagels and bialys, I'm sure they're no longer in business.
