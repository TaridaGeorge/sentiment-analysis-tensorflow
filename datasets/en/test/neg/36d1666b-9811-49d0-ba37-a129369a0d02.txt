if i could give this place less than one star i would.

this place was horrible. i had a habenjero burger - i think they mixed the pepper with garlic. it wasn't spicy at all. the fries are also coated in garlic and ... i ate a good lot of them because they were bareable, but they were pretty damn gross. the house beers are lame.

it was WAY over priced for food that didn't deserve to be on a Chili's menu.

just please. go somewhere else.

also, my girlfriend had a martini and there was a pit in the olive... that was a bit startling.. so, if you DO go, be prepared for that.
