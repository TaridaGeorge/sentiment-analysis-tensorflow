We stayed at the Hyatt Place in Scottsdale in January, 2009.  For all of us it was our first time staying at a Hyatt Place (I'd actually never heard of the chain).  The amenities were nice, the rooms were spacious, and the free WiFi was great.   The lack of room service was a bit of an annoyance but apparently serves as an indication of how the hotel views hospitality at large.  Never in all my hotel stays (which range over 100 times a year) have I been so poorly treated by hotel staff.  I cannot, would not, and will not ever recommend staying at this hotel - no matter how much you save over local competitors or how pretty the lobby decorations are.
