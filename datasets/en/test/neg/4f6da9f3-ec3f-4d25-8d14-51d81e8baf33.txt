OVER PRICED and DIRTY

None of the bulk is wrapped like at Candy Addict so little kids taste stuff then put SPIT covered gummies back into the bins.  GROSE !  If you have bought bulk from there, You have tasted some little kits spit all over it.... just nasty!

They are SOOOO over priced. 
They charge about 50% than Candy Addict on MIll Ave or Sweeties and their selection is not good.  Candy Addict has over 2000, yes I said 2000 kinds of candy.

SAve yourself from a corperate rip off... go to a real candy store like sweeties or candy addict.
