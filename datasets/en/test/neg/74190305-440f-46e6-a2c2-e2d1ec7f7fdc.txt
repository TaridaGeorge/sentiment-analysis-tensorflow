Avoid this place if you have any food allergies at all. Ordered for my child, who is allergic to tree nuts, a "classic" french toast, he started eating it and said it was spicy. Found out it had pecans mixed in the bread ! It wasn't listed in the menu description, and the server said they make it with "whatever old bread they have lying around".
We luckily treated the allergy in time with medication, but this is potentially very dangerous and simply unacceptable.
