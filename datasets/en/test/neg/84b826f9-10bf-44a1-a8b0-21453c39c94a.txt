You can pretty much copy-paste all the previous comments/reviews here too.  

Lazy service, under/mismanaged, dirty, poor products.  Unfortunate too, because they have the tools and opportunity to be a really, really neat niche.  The GC in Litchfield Park is WAY better.  C'mon Ground Control, get your managing act together!
