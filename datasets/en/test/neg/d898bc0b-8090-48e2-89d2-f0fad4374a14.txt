I've been to this place three times, and now it's off my list.  The actual service wasn't bad...typical car wash.  The greeters are horrifying.  They're pushy, sales people.  They don't take no for an answer, and keep trying to get you to spend more money.  It's just uncomfortable.  I won't be back.
