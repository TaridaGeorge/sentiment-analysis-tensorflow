I would not necessarily recommend eating sushi here.  There was way too much fish and it made us uncomfortable for the price.  I like high-quality sushi and when eating raw fish, I don't think this is negotiable.  This is not high-quality.  It's high-quantity.  I was pretty disappointed.  Service and ambiance also left much to be desired.  

Also, the menu was very confusing.  The descriptions have no prices.  The prices are only on the sushi order sheet which was hiding for the first 30 minutes.
