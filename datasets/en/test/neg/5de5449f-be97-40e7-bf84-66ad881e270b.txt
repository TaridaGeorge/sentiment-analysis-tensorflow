I would have liked this place if I were still 15-years-old, but probably not even then. Imagine some sort of weird Red Lobster/Joe's Crab Shack setting, but filled with binge-drinkers from the worst of the Scottsdale and Tempe crowd. The perfect example of a gimmicky establishment that tries far too hard.

I've given this place one or two reviews in the past, but like others here, my reviews were also flagged and deleted by the "community" (read: the owner).

Oh, well.
