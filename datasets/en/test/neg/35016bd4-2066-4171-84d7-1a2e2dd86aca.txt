I walked in with my sister and my boyfriend.  We wanted to see a menu before sitting down.  We were greeted by someone in a way-too-tight nurse's costume.  Every single man in the place turned around and stared at us.  Every man in there sat alone at the counter with a beer.  I wondered if we had accidentally walked into a strip club, based on the layout, the customers, and the wait staff.  The little nurse politely but loudly told us the menu was painted on the wall.  Heart attack burgers, "flat line fries", unfiltered lucky strikes and buckets of beer.  That's it.  So we turned around and politely walked out as fast as we could.
