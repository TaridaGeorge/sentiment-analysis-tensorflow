Worthless:

The "High Pressure Soap" contains no soap. I figured fine, at least I can use it to knock off some dust. I use the "spotless rinse", and 20 minutes later once my car is dry it's covered in hard water spots. 
So to re-iterate, save $5-10 by just rinsing your car down with the hose at home, this place does the same thing.
