SWEET SAUSE! 
If you love sugar on your pizza then this is the place for you, if they had put regular sauce on their pizza this place would have a 5 star rating from me.  Too bad.  
We have kids so we ordered the pizza for pick up, the staff was friendly and the place was cute, the pizza LOOKED amazing.  We got pep and sausage, the cheese and pep and sausage were great, but the sauce ruined it completely.  We basically just took $25 and threw it in the trash, I will never go there again and I would highly recommend people who don't like sugar on their pizza to not go there.
