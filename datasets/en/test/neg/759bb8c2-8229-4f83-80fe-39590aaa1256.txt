The photo says it all............I walked in, and left.    Snottsdale has sadly turned into a Breasts on Parade town,..and in this case, midriffs and booties as well.    I've now heard the restaurant nicknamed Four Cheeks....:(

It's an insult to see these young girls foolishly putting themselves on display.  

Having said that - it's really loud in there.....rustic decor....

Head to Four Peaks Brewery/Restaurant in the same parking lot......the girls there are intelligent and wear clothes.
