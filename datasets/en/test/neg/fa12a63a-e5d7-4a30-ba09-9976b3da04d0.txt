OVERPRICED BAD PIZZA!   The pizza is nothing more than a pricier version of dominos.   The atmosphere is more of a club than a restaurant in Gilbert.    Do yourself a favor and keep driving in either direction for better food.   Plus kind of spendy, one beer for 7$...   Really.    I also ordered a salad which came with so little dressing on it I thought they had forgot it.   I asked for a side and was charged 1$.   Its not fun to be nickel and dimed!   


I just wish it would close down quickly so we can have a better option at that location.
