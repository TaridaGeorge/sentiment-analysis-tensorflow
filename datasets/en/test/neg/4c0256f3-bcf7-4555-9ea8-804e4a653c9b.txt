Took my mom on  10/3/12 to this hospital and I can only said, I have never had such as bad experience in another hospital like I did on this,  ER staff including the doctors very unprofessional, rude, more interested n texting than doing there job, had to take my mom out because they refuse to transfer her to another hospital, stay away from this place..
