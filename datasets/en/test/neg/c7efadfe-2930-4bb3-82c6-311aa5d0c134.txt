Disappointed. This wasn't our first time but it will be our last. First, my wife's wine glass had some suck-on food from its previous owner. Then her rigatoni with chicken in pink vodka sauce had bad chicken. She described it as chicken that had been in the refrigerator too long. My food was good. I had the lobster ravioli special.

Our server replaced my wife's glass and promptly ordered a rigatoni without chicken. A manager never visited our table and that ruined the place for us. I understand that mistakes happen. But for the manager to not address the problem or even take the add-on chicken off the bill is unacceptable.
