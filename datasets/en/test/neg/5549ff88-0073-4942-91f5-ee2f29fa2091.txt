Three strikes..... We had hoped our dinner last night would have changed our minds in order to keep this DC Ranch spot on our radar. Unfortunately, we were were disappointed  yet again with the very average entrees that were served. Guests of ours who frequent the sister locations in Chicago were equally surprised at the inferior and uninspired meals. It was evident that other food savvy locals must agree as it was Friday night and not too many patrons were present....although the new Market Street kitchen was bustling. Our party had at least  7 different entrees and all agreed.  On a side note... Davanti (old Quilted Bear location) has same ownership and is on the top of our must return soon list. Amazing how two chefs can differ so much! With so many goodies in Scottsdale, there is very little wiggle room for average. Quality control alert.....
