I have never had worse service in my life!!! From the lady at the front counter to waiting for 15 min at the snack bar, only to be greeted by someone who did not say a word to me and acted like I was bothering her. I told the manager he said he would give me some coupons.. Never did. It's crazy I've been here before and it was always fine this time seriously the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!
