Thought I should update my last experience concerning the volunteering situation at Ballet AZ.  I waited a couple of years and went back and offered my services.  Must have been my instincts because i delayed sending them the paperwork.  Just as well because I was told soon after they "rescinding" their offer to have me do volunteer work with them???  This happened awhile back now, but last I heard the same people are handling that area so doubt if things have changed any.  

You be the judge
