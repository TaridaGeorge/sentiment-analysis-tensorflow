Located in the HORRIBLE Tempe Marketplace with its scary traffic flow and layout (very difficult to locate since it does not face the main parking lot). 
My daughter was looking specifically for a caramelized onion dip that her husband loved from their California BevMo. The checkout person checked and this BevMo does not carry the item. 
I had been in here previously when they had a buy one get a 2nd bottle for $0.05 only to find out that the wine I had selected was not included in that special. I see NO reason to return.
