If you like food that has been sitting out for a dangerously long time without properly maintained temperatures in the midst of bleak looking gaudy decor all wrapped up in a ridiculous price then this is the place for you. If you want anything fresh you would have to wait 30 minutes to an hour just for them to replace it. It was like a creepy cafeteria.

By the way, what happened to the ice cream?

And have fun getting sick after you are finished with your delightful meal.

They even put false photos of a really nice looking buffet in their mailing advertisements, it is NOTHING like what they describe.

I just wasted $20 that I could have spent at many other great places like The Golden Buddha, and I probably would've ate more food over there since I wouldn't have gotten sick.
