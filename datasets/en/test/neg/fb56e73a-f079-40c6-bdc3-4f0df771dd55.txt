Hard to say much about this experience pleased me. We got there later on at night, around 10pm or so, and waited at the door for at least 5 minutes (by the please wait to be seated sign) before deciding to walk up to the bartender. She said, ''Oh, sit anywhere," and handed us menus. So we headed outside, picked a table, and then sat for about 10 minutes before anyone came up to us. When a server finally did come up, she was far from pleasant, seemed more annoyed than anything that we were there, and took our order. Food came fast, but was sub-par, and then we sat and waited again for her to even check on us. Let's just say her tip reflected it.
