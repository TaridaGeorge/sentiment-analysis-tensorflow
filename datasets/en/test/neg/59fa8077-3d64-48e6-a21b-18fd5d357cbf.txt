I've heard good things about the restaurant downstairs, but I stopped by the upstairs hookah lounge with some friends one night and was definitely put off by this place. Firstly, the price of the drinks is outrageous. $2.50 for a ~6oz cup of coffee? I ordered tea, same size cup. And what's more, they didn't have milk. What kind of place serves coffee and tea and doesn't have milk/creamer on hand? What's more, they won't accept credit card charges below $5, which is against Visa's merchant agreement. This place is just horrible, avoid it entirely.
