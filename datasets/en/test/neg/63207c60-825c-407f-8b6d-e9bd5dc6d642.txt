I truly do not know why I go to Last Chance!  The last few times I have gone I have told myself I will never go back but I seem to forget what I told myself and I find myself driving to last chance.  The parking is always terrible and once you are inside you are pushed, shoved, knocked out of the way so someone can get their hands on a beat up pair of Betsey Johnson shoes, it is truly insane in this store.  
I don't mind a little hunt for a great pair of pants, but most of the clothes are used and torn or missing a button or two and maybe the zipper doesn't work.  
I have found better bargains at TJ Maxx, or Marshalls.  
Don't waste your time.
