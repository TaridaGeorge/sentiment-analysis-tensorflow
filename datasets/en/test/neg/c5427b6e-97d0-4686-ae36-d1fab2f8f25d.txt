If your idea of a good sandwich involves a copious amount of bread with very little meat, this is the place for you. I had the Pastrami, it was microwaved (ugghh). Service was less than friendly. Witnessed a manager type apologizing and offering comped food to two different groups for return visits. When a deli with Brooklyn in the name cannot construct a proper Pastrami on rye, no need to delve any further. Might pass as a bakery for a loaf to go perhaps.
