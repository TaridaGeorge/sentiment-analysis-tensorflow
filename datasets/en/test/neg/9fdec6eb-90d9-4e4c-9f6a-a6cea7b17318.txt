If you want to drink housefly go here.
Yes it is true. I liked the onion dosa and the tamarind rice and this server refilled my glass of water and I was busy reading something and about half glass of water inside me, I saw a big housefly died and floating in the water. Man, the owner billed me and went to him and talked about housefly. He wasn't apologetic in the beginning and handed me a $5 coupon for next time. I told "sorry I don't think I will ever come again".
