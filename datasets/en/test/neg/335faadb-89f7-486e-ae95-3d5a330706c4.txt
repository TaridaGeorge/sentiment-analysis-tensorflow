I would like anyone who has gone to Insight Imaging for mammography in 2007, 2008, 2009 or 2010 and they were unable to find your films for comparison when you had your 2010 mammography done.  Please contact me if you have been told that they lost your records or had nothing to compare them to or that they had sent previous records to your doctor but your doctor doesn't have them.  Thanks so much.
