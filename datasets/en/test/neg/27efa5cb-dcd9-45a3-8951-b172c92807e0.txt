I have been to this MAC store on three occasions because I love MAC products and it is close to my home.  Each time I'm there, the staff is unhelpful and unfriendly.  On my last two visits, I was told that they are out of the items I need.  At first I thought it was bad timing but after my third visit this evening with the same crappy treatment, including waiting several minutes to see if they have the item I need (again, they were "out" of not only the lipstick shade, but also the concealer and foundation), I have completely given up. Very disappointing; I will definitely not shop here again.
