Hmmm...the conversation went something like this:

Me: I'd like to get this skirt hemmed.
Her: I can do that; it would take approximately 10 days.
Me: And what is the cost?
Her: Twenty eight dollars ($28.00).
Me: [Choking] What!?  $28.00!?
Her: Honey, if you don't want to pay that, you don't have to.  I don't have time for this [walking away from me and the front of the store].
Me: OK.  I guess that's settled [walking away from her and out the front door].

I guess this establishment doesn't need the money...nor the goodwill.
