#FAIL #DeathOfTheAmericanDream

Can't tell you how irritating it is to me to see a grand opening and nobody on quality control.

Cheese and ingredients were unmelted and cold atop a crust that was cool in the center. The thin crust was cooked all the way through but the ingredients were gloppy and unpleasant. I complained, no offer was made to refund us for our troubles.

This appears to be another location for Crust Pizza & Wine, which has some pretty good reviews. Perhaps I should stop holding Scottsdale pizza to NY standards. More likely: somebody from corporate needs to check up on the new location.
