Total disappointment. The food was okay but the service was ridiculous.  The only way they stay in business is the captive resort audience. We waited for 30 minutes for a table for dinner during which I counted about 15+ open tables in the restaurant!  The majority of tables were open and still a 30 minute wait and very poor service. Total bummer!
