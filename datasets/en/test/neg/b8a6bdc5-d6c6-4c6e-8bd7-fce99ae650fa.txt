Even after hearing about this place for years, I had still not taken the time to check it out.  Tonight was the night.

When my friend and I walked in, the waitress looked at us, then the clock and with a big sigh said, "We close at 9:30."  We thought about informing her that it was only 8:45, which meant they were open for nearly another hour but, instead, we just turned around and walked out.

I doubt I will ever return.  What a nasty first impression to give out to people.  Judging from some of the other reviews on in, I'm not the only one underwhelmed with the customer service here.  Can't judge the food.
