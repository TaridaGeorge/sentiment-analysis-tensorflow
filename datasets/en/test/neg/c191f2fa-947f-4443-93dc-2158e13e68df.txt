Unfortunately, the review I recently read about the terrible smell was accurate.  We first went here shortly after it opened and it was terrific.  We finally got around to going back.  We walked in the door and it smelled terrible - something not unlike urine as one reviewer said.  There was one table occupied (6:30pm on a Saturday).  We understood why.  We turned around and left.  I hope they can fix this problem and return to what they showed themselves capable of early on.
