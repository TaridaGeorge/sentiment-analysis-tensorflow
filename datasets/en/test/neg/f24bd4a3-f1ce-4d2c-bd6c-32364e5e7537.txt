Stay away from this place. 

Let's see, the bulgogi was terrible, and extremely overdone. Customer service was horrible, I had to wait 15 minutes before I could order. When the owner's wife finally came out, she seemed to be in a bad mood because she didn't smile at all. Lame.

If you come here you will QQ.
