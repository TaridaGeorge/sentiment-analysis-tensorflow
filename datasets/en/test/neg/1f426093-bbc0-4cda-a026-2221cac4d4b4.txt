CLOSED FOR GOOD... due to poor management/ownership.. The upper management snuck in during the cover of darkness, like the bunch of cockroaches they are... Took anything of value.. Staff comes in the next day to find the place barren and closed. No notice to staff, no notice to anyone.. and if they follow their track record, no payment for anyone they owe money.
