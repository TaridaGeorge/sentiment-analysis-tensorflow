I am the husband that Linda refers to in the 1st review, I CANNOT express how VERY disappointed I am in Estrella Animal Hospital and have certainly spread the word as to their lack of attention and compassion at a time of real need.  We used to bring them 6 clients... yes 6, but now it will be ZERO based on this unfortunate discision made by them on a Friday.  Would any other "hospital" turn away a potential dying patient?  I hate to think what would have happened had we shown up without calling first.
