Went back for our 4th or 5th time, the new Summer Lobster menu lured us in. All three of us ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Summer Salad. Big disappointment. As we drove away I said " maybe I don't really like Lobster". My companions felt it wasn't really lobster. The Shrimp wasn't that good, either. The vegetables were great, but at $22.95 for a salad, it's not worth it. My salad had half a dozen small mushrooms, my wife found only one in hers. If this had been our first visit, we would not return. We may not anyway. Suggest if this is the best they can do, 86 the salad.
