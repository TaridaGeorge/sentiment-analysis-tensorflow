God I wish there was such a thing as negative stars.  The Company is the absolute worst Company in the World.  Not just the worst Airline.  They truly SUCK in the biggest way!

I used to travel to Phoenix every week for business.  America West has left me stranded so many times I can not even count on both hands and feet.  They make me sick!

And every employee of the company hates the airline and their jobs too.  nobody cares because their management sucks so bad.

Please God, send a lightning bolt to each of the Executives of this company!!!!
