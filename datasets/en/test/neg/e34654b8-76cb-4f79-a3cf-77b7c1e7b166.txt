Yes this is indeed a bar.  Lots of bars serve good food, but this isn't one of them.
The service, on the other hand, was excellent.  Our server was fast, courteous, attentive and we were impressed with her.  She should get a job at a place that serves good food.
The Chicken Ceasar salad was ok, except for the chicken!  It was a small portion of chicken and served in small lumps that tasted like they had been somehow friend in pork or something.  A very off-putting flavor.
The Ravioli tasted like it was straight out of a can.
My guess is that the burgers and sandwiches might be good, just stay away from Chicken or Italian.
