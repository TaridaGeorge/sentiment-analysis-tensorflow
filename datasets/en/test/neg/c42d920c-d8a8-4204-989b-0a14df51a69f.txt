Jimmy Johns!  I longed for the  food and service I got from Jimmy's in the midwest (Nebraska).  What I found here was a small store with more employees than patrons and each was schooled in the art of customer indifference.  I waited forever for a completely mediocre sandwich served by a suppurating summer-work adolescent.   I am reluctant  to try the Jimmy's on Elliot lest my dreams of a succulent #9 be forever dashed.
