We had a horrible service experience here.  Saturday night:  wife and I had a rare night out and excited to check out the restaurant we've heard much about.  Had reservations, but still waited 20 min to get seated even though we could see open tables.  Not a big deal, but it got worse.  We waited another 15 min before the waitress came by and then still waited another 30 min before our drinks came to the table.  We spoke up, politely:  they acknowledged and apologized, but didn't seem to really care.  They even forgot to bring out one of small plates we ordered.
A couple of plates were tasty and a couple left much to be desired....seemed okay, not nearly as good as all the hype.
We won't be returning and I can't imagine this place will be in business much longer.
