I was apprehensive to begin with, but it's a newer looking restaurant so I gave it a try. I guess it was a bad idea. The food was old and lacked taste. Old chicken becomes very chewy and I just gave up without finishing my meal. I wish I could say the few bites I did have were worth the calories, but it was not the case.
