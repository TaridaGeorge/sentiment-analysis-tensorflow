I hope the people who wrote reviews before me are just kidding. 

This cafe is awful and overpriced. maybe we're not talking about the same place?

i once got 2 slices of wheat toast and a large diet coke. how much did it cost? $7.50! 

this place has nasty microwaved food for way more than any of it is worth. 

they go to costco and buy things, then wrap them up and sell them for $2-4 a piece.

I once brought my dinner to class but needed a fork. they wanted to charge me for a fork. 

this place makes me angry, all the people who work there are slow and dumb. 


there's a jack in the box up the street and when we have time to leave we go there and are much happier and don't spend $7 on something like a microwaved soft pretzel.
