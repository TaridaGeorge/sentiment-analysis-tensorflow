This place is disgusting! Not only does the entire casino smells of smoke, be prepared to shower and wash all your clothes once you get home. The bingo room was dirty and smoke filled the air....no ventilation anywhere& the people working behind the counter seemed uninterested in helping us. 
The casino itself is no better. The machines are close together which make it difficult to walk around& again, its smokey. 

The club card is a joke and the "free" $10 credits never worked! While other people in my party went on to gamble I was being ripped off & became irritated, leaving w/nothing but the smell of smoke stuck to my entire body.
Hate this place & will never return.
