I moved to Aderra with great expectations and now I wish I had not made the move.  They are not pet friendly, have no place to store your bike and only allow 3 potted plants on your balcony.

Until recently we were allowed to walk our animals in the security of the complex, but that has all changed.  You must now take your animals outside the fence and walk them on an unlit path next to the golf course.  There is no security on the path and the coyotes have a home near the course.

It is not a friendly community and the community manager and HOA are not receptive to finding any solutions.  It is so bad that the HOA allows owners to verbally assault tenants and in a way condones this action.
