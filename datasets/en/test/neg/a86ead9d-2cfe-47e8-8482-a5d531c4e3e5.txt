This place is god awful. The people are fine until you have a problem then they are the rudest people on earth. Most boxed items have a pound of tape closing them up for good reason. They dont want you to see what is in the box. They want you to buy it and then get home and find out only half the pieces are there. When you go back and try to get them to make it right, they point out the "as-is" on the receipt (which you dont get until you have paid). Then they just want you out of their store. If you tell them you will dispute the charge on your CC (they take those now), they start swearing at you in english and some other unknown language and make threats. It's not a good place. Stay away and save yourself the aggravation.
