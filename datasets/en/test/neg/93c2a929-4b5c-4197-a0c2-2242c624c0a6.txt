This is the third time I eat here. We came here because my wife like to shop at Lee Lee.
the first time was good authentic Chinese food. Small portion for the price, but I accept it, I figure they have hi overhead. 
The second time, less authentic ...but still Chinese food, small portion as compare to other Chinese place.
Last week, they probably have a janitor cooking in the kitchen.  No wonder they have empty dinning room.
I won't be eating here again,...not anytime soon.
