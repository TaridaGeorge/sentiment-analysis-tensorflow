CS, wow. Really hit them hard.

I don't really disagree, cause I will never recommend this place or ever go back. There was a Dennis guy there who was a total turn off, I hope he doesn't own the place, but he did act like he did. Our Service was very old school, like where they did not care about you. They also didn't look happy to be there. News Flash, change your life.

We were hungry, and that was the first place we saw, so we dipped in. Big mistake, it could of been the beginning of a horror movie.

Next time Native New Yorker or Buffalo Wild Wings.
