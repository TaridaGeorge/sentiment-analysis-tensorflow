This place is just awful.  Dirty and membership required (which is such a pain).  

It's difficult to find what you're looking for also.  The set up is just odd.  We scrolled back and forth between the aisles trying to find marshmallows.  They're almost always in the baking section.  Not here.  Over near paper towels and toilet paper.

It's a zoo.  Go somewhere else!
