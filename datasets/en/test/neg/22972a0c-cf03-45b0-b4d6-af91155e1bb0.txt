Hi Lux!  Your business hours on your website and on Google list your hours of operation on Friday and Saturday as being open until 2am.  After a play this evening at the Herberger, we decided to find a place to grab some coffee and hang out and were so happy when we checked online and saw that you should be open late.  Unfortunately, we were turned away when we tried to order because it was 10pm and you guys were closing, even though there were several dozen other people hanging around inside and outside enjoying coffee, working on laptops, chatting, etc.  It looks like Yelp is the only place that is listing your correct hours of business.  You might want to change that. Thanks!
