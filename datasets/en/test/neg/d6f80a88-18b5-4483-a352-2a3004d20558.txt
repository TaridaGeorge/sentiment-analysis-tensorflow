The  first  two  times  I  went  there  it  was  ok  but  yesterday  I  decided  not  to  come  back:  I  ordered  the  "Cashew nut  chicken"   and  what  I  got  where  chunks  of  deep  fried  chicken  fat  (the  stuff  that  i  usually  cut  off  and  give  to my  dogs),  no  white  meat,  just  disgusting  chicken  garbage.   Altogether  there  were  7  cashew nuts  on  my  plate  (yes,  I  counted  them).   When  i  received  my  dish  my  wife  had  already  finished  her  dish  because  they  did  not serve  our  dishes  at  the  same  time.  

 Nobody  came  to  ask  if  we  liked  the  food,  what  I  was  hoping  for,  instead  someone  threw  a  comments  card  onto  our  table.
