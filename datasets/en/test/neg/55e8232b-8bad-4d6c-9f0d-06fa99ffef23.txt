I went in a few weeks ago and the man that took care of me was very rude. He jerked my feet around, throwing them back and forth. The water was too hot. When i was trying to make up my mind about a color he said i leave you call me when you make up your mind, but hurry I have not had my lunch yet. Then he charged me 10$ extra for putting crackel polish that i supplied. When I questioned why he said it not the product, it the time it took to do it. Really???? It was just one coat of MY polish. I will NEVER go back there again.
