Spare yourself. There are so many places to eat in this area and Village Inn should not be on your list.

Ordered a to-go breakfast (first mistake) and the waitress who took the order apparently wasn't used to questions. "Can you replace pork with turkey?" "Ummmm I don't know." Uh, what?

I ordered the steak (medium) and eggs and my order was a pile of blob, with well done steak, which couldn't be torn apart because it was made of rubber. BFF orders french toast... turns out to be bread with generic strawberry jam. 

It was so bad, we returned the order and went somewhere else. Don't lower your breakfast standards!
