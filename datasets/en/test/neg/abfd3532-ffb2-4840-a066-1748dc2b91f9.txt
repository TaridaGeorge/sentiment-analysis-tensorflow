This place is not safe to live in. They claim it is a gated community but the gates are broken and left open more then closed. There have been several burglaries including my place. They charge you for everything like other reviewers have mentioned. Most outrageous fees I have ever encountered, worst then NYC where I have lived before. The staff is rude and unprofessional. They will not help you at all. The place is also dirty, the grounds are kept unclean. They will try to jack up the rent and charge you ridiculous amounts when you try to move out. They do lot of gimmicks to try to get you to move in and once you are in they trap you with fees. The walls are thin, pigeon droppings all over and shady management . Avoid at all costs!
