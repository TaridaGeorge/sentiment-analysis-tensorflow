This was the worst one I've ever been to! The service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door. No one greeted us or even acknowledged us!! It took awhile for our waitress to pay any attention to us and I had 2 kids with me!! I will never again go to this waffle house! The only reason it gets a star is because I had to!!
