Was visiting Scottsdale last week with a friend for baseball spring training. Ordered a round of drinks. Had a second & thought I was under charged. That's when the waitress told us between 3 & 7 it was 1/2 price happy hour. Great! Came back the second day after the game at 4:00 for drinks & ordered a round. Waitress said $11. I asked her wasn't it happy hr? She was very apologetic. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Came back the third day after a game at 5:00 & ordered a round. The third different server said $11. Again I asked him wasn't it happy hr? He apologized & charged us happy hr prices. We were not happy. We felt like they were trained to cheat tourists. We were wearing  our Giants garb. We will not go there again.
