I have heard amazing things about La Bocca's pizza. I was really looking forward to it when an event announced that is where the after party was to be held. La Bocca was offering our group discounts etc...

We arrived at roughly 9p and waited and waited for the wait staff to acknowledge us. At this point 35 minutes had pasted. No luck. I approached a waiter and was told "I am not with the Ignite party and can't help you. I will see if I can find someone for you." 

We waited another 10 minutes and decided to leave. I think 45 minutes is a long time to wait to even see a waiter.
