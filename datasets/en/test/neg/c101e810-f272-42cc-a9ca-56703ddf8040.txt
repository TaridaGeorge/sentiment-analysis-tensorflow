So I figured I would go to a dealer for my first bike, man was that a mistake. First they delivered it with a dead battery, and the guy tried to get me to sign for the bike. They took it back and took 2 days to put a freaking battery in. I get it back, and a little while later I notice the rear brakes are squeaking.... loudly. They did an improper brake check (none) and put pads on without grease. To Top it all off I found out (on the side of the road) they didn't put any god damn oil in the thing. DO NO GO HERE THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF.
