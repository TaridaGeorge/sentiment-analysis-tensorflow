This subway is horrible. The food is old and when I went in the morning for breakfast, the lady was rude and didn't want to listen to what I wanted. I asked for coffee and she told me to go to mcdonalds next door, it's cheaper. I told her I don't want to go to mcdonalds I want subway coffee and she stared at me like I had 2 heads. 

There are enough subways around I don't ever need to go to this one again.
