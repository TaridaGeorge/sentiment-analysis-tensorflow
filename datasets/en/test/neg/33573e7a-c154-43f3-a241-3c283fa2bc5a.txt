Have tried this place on 3 different occasions, the last and final one being today.  The service was TERRIBLE.  I was the ONLY person in the place and the woman behind the counter made me wait, without even acknowledging my existance while she looked through some sort of tickets. I then asked if I could place my order and then she said, (without even looking up from the stack of paper) "in a minute."  So I just stood there staring at her.  BAD start!  Food is very greasy and chicken was very fatty and majority of it was not edible.  
The positive of the place is that the portion size is large.  Even the mini meal which I got today was more than enough for 1 person's lunch.
