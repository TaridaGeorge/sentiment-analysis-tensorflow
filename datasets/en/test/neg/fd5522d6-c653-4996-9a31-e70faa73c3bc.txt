One of the worst Chinese Buffets I have ever been to. Everything looked like it had been sitting for hours upon hours.

I never judge on looks alone, so I tried some of the food but it was disgusting. Even their deserts tasted like shit.

Not only will I never eat here again, but I would suggest you stay away also.

I just hope that my stomach doesn't pay for this later on tonight
