Very disappointed.  While they appear to have a good selection of grocery items, the sandwiches selection was very limited, especially given that they have cases and cases of meats.  Worse yet, the preparation of two simple sandwiches took FOREVER.  Not a good spot if you are trying to grab something to go.
