This review is in reference to the online portion of the store.

The website says nothing about the store being closed. You can place an  order and pay for the order and then just wait.

And wait.

E-mails and phone calls aren't responded to, looking on here, now I realize because the store is obviously closed. If the store has been closed since at least Feb. 2011, I think August, 2011 might be well past  due to put this on the site and stop allowing orders to fester.
