Boo! Went with a big birthday group after confirming business hours. Got their well over 30 mins before their posted closing business time. Told us kitchen was already closed and turned us away!
I would understand if it was a bar/sportsbar where they have last calls for kitchen food and a bar to operate later than their kitchen. If a restaurant has certain hours, I was always under the impression the kitchen is open until the closing time. 
May take a while for me to want to come back here. Even tried to plead our case and it was a no go as the host sat there counting his money. Wow.
