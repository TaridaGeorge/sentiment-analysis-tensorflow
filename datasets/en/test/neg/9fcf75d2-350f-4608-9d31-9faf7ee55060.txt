We installed the Kvar unit and we see no energy savings at all.  When we contacted the company they said they wanted to see our electric bills so I scanned the last year and email all to them.  We never got a call back.  I called them several times but they could not give any answer as to why there were no savings. They did claim that there was a savings but we have not seen it or a lower electric bill.  I think this unit is not worth the cost.  In fact  2  of my neighbors have this unit and they agree it is not worth the money.
