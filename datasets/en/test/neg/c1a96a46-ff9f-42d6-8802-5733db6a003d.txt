Alright, my first job was in a bakery where we sold the most popular doughnuts in town so I think I have a decent idea of what is a 'good' doughtnut.

I can only imagine that those who like these just haven't eaten doughnuts anywhere other than Krispy Kreme.  
Mostly raised doughnuts, primarily the glazed variety.  Small, greasy flavor and barely anything inside the filled doughnuts.

Not worth the money for the selection of mediocre.

You want a delicious doughnut?
Check out the neighborhood Basha's grocery stores.  Their filled doughnuts are filled.  Custard, creme, raspberry, cherry, sometimes apple too.  They have apple, cherry and blueberry fritters.  Their buttermilk sticks are twice the size of the ones they sell at BoSa.  The selection included cake and the raised variety. AND on Fridays you get a half dozen free when you buy a dozen.  
I'm sticking with the area Basha's.  Yum.
