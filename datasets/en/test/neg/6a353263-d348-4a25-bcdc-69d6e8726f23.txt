WORST place I've ever been to!!! Older lady did a color change on my acrylics. Painted uneven. Could see through in some areas. I asked her if I should use non acetone or acetone polish to take nail polish off because it was awful and she said acetone. (that's what she used to take off my nail polish) I looked it up and it said non acetone... My nails are hardly on now... Nails I've only had on for a week... Luckily I didn't get them applied there. I will NEVER go back!!!
