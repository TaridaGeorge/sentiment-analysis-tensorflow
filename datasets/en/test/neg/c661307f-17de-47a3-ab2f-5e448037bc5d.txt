took my car in for an oil change.  everything seemed fine until 2 days later my skid plate underneath my car fell off.  I took it back to gruelich's and they claimed they did not touch the skid plate during the oil change.  they said i must have knocked it loose by hitting a curb (which i did not do).  took my car immediately to the dealership and was told 1 of 2 things happened;  either gruelich's did not replace the skid plate properly after the oil change so it came loose and fell off or gruelich's did not really even do the oil change at all because they are lying when they say they did not have to remove the skid plate to do the oil change.  i haven't taken my car back since and just go to the dealership for oil changes.
