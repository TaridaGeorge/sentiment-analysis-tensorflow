Is one star the lowest I can do. I don't care if food is good or bad the service is horrendous. These people need serious training in waiting on people. 

It just never got better. The owner defended the smallest rolls I have ever seen at a sushi joint. The waitress was just rude.

Watched 3 tables just walk out after waiting more than 15 minutes to get served. 

Rolls are small and expensive but good.

Seriously have no clue how this place is in business.
