Pros: cute 
Nice wAit staff


Cons: price 35+ per plate
Taste: bland and under done meat cooked wrong
Lighting: very dark 
Cold plates and food.
When two plates were taken back for taste they showed up anyway on our bill
When we had an issue with our food the manager only came to the table once, the chef never came out, the food was solid OK if we were at applebees this would still only be three stars
