I have been getting solicitation calls from a service called the lunch line who was hired by Kitchen 56 to do their marketing.  They continue to call me and harrass me with recorded messages to visit this restaurant.  When you call the number back it says the number is not in service.  After asking them to cease their marketing efforts, I continued to get calls and even had to purchase a phone application to block calls from them.   I am having my attorney send them a cease and desist letter to stop being harassed by this company. I would NEVER eat at this restaurant after being harassed by them.
