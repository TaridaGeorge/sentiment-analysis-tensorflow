Takamatsu in Chandler is overall way better than this phoenix location. This location charges $1.25 for extra rice & a $1.00 per extra side dish. I came in with a party of 6 and of course we ran out of several side dishes since the serving size was equivalent to what they serve a party of 2.  The service was also incredibly sloooow. I will not be returning to this location.
