The food was great and the waiter Patrick was very attentive. We were the last ones to leave on a Saturday night. My cell phone was left on the seat. After realizing while still in the car I called and there was no answer. The next day no one could find it. I strongly recommend not to bring anything of value to this restaurant, cause the employees will not turn it in to lost and found
