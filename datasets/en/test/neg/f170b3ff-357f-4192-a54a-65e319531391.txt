I always see the placed packed after ball games. So, today we decide to try the place for some lunch. Horrible. I guess it's meant for more of a drinking and social establishment rather than food. 
My slice of pizza was worse than Peter Piper Pizza and came out before the rest of the table's food (by like 10 mins), my friend's hot dog was horrible and the bun was stale and her mother's wrap didn't have very much turkey for being a turkey wrap. The fries were the only good thing. 
None of us finished our food. I was tempted to pay for a game ticket to go get food inside the stadium instead of the food at the restaurant.
