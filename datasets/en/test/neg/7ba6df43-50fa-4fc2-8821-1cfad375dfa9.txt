I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.

The bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's "one person" for both directions.

Then to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times.
