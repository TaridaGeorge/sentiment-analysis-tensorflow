Gross. I haven't had PF Chang's in a few years until recently. Ate several of their dishes that were ordered to go. The food was absolutely (and surprisingly) terrible!! It had all the wrong flavors. Orange chicken tasted nothing like I am used to (in a very bad way). The egg rolls were the only half good item that I ate. Everything out of the 7+ dishes that I ate was not worth eating. Believe it or not I think that Panda Express (yes the fast food version of Chinese) would have tasted better than what I ate. I do not know how this restaurant is so popular?!
