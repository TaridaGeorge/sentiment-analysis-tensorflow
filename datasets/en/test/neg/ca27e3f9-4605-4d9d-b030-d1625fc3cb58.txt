Was highly disappointed with this place after hearing good things... the good things were lies I tell ya, all lies. This fish was just awful and some of the saltiest stuff I have ever put to my lips. I didn't eat what I bought and I won't be going back. Long John Silver's looks like gold compared to this place.
