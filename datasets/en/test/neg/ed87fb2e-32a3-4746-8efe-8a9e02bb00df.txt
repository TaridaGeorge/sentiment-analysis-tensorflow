Sadly, I have nothing positive to say about our dining experience here. 

The dining area smelled like smoke (the door was open and there were smokers eating nearby on the outdoor patio).

We waited 10 minutes just for the waiter to acknowledge us. Waited another 35 minutes for our food (no exaggeration -- I was timing it and almost walked out).

When the food finally came, I could only take a few bites before I started to get nauseous. As soon as I'm done with this review, I'm looking for a bottle of Pepto-Bismol.

They could definitely stand to make their service a little more efficient and their menu a little more digestible.
