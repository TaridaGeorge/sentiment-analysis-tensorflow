I have used Danny's for 30 years.  I have used this location since it opened a few years ago.  I have to say, it is absolutely horrible.  There have been many instances of the car not even being vacuumed but in this latest incident all four of my floor mats were taken.  When I called to recover them....gee..they just weren't there.  I didn't notice they were missing until I got home as I was late for an appointment.  The mats were there when I pulled in to get it washed and gone when I next stopped.  Who do you think took them?  I called the corporate office.  They COULDN'T HAVE CARED LESS!!!!!!!!!   After a long relationship, I will never used Danny's again.
