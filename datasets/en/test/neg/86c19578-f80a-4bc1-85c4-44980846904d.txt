I went here with my husband on a Saturday evening, not during happy hour. Cons: The food is way over priced, the portions are extremely small, and the sushi tastes awful. I've had better sushi at an irish pub in New Mexico...that should just about explain it. If I ever go back it will be during happy hour for drinks and a snack that does not consist of sushi.
