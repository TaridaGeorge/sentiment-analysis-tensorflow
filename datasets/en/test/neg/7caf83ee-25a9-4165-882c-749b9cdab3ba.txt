I haven't been here in a long time but now I know why.  It was overpacked and the crowd was awful.  Felt like I was in a bad part of Phoenix or something.  Very trashy.  When I went to go to the bathroom, some guy was smoking a black and mild or something INDOORS by the hallway!!  ugh would not willingly return to this dump.
