DON'T ORDER ONLINE OR THROUGH GRUBHUB.  What a disaster!

They literally don't know how to work their email, cashier doesn't even know their email address, they claimed they didn't get the confirmation from Grubhub (which I did receive) and then claimed it was my fault, etc., etc.  They are just super incompetent. Don't open up online ordering if you're not able to accommodate online orders hassle-free.  Shame.
