I did give this place a 5 stars ... 
But very disappointed with my latest visit ... Honestly, I am very glad to see this store expands and getting lot more business since their expansion with cleaner interior and all ... but what happened to the quality ?!?! 
It seems they are putting less meat into the bowl these days ... and worst of all, I found a hair in my pho today !!!   
I understand with more people coming in, you try to cut cost ... but at least keep it clean ... !!!   I am done with this place
