I was just reminded of my horrible experience at this hospital when I was at a much better hospital this past weekend.

Years ago I came into this hospital because of severe eye pain following an eye surgery.  I was put in a bed and put in a dark room.  Everything was fine, until I noticed the smell.

The bed they had put me in was soaked with urine.  The sheets were clean when I laid down on the bed, but apparently someone had just put new sheets on a urine soaked bed.

Rather than apologize, the nurse on staff mentioned that "Sometimes people that come in that are in extreme pain wet themselves.  Its nothing to be embarassed about."  Really?  REALLY?

Absolutely disgusting.
