If I could give less than 1 star, I would. This is by far the worst pharmacy. Last week they had me run a prescription back to them that they gave me that was not mine. Today, two of the rudest pharmacists (and the pharmacy mgr is rude) both told me to circle back around because they hadn't started processing a refill that was called in 3 days ago! All this took me was 45 min in the car, and this isn't the first time they've been rude and taken forever. I'll be driving farther to a pharmacy that isn't rude and screwing up. They never fail!
