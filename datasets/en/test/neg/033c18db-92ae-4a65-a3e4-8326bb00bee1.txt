My first feeling upon my arrival at Darque Tan was AWKWARD. The receptionist was taking a smoke break with some friends and considering smoke smell is not the most pleasant thing to be greeted with, it made me feel uncomfortable to approach the salon and walk in. And so I did, not only to have to wait while she had to clean every single bed because she was too busy prior to have that maintained.  This happened the second time I went back as well. Let's just say the minute my package expires I'll be looking for a great tanning salon. Any recommendations?
