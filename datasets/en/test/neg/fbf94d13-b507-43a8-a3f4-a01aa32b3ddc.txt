Interesting  Closure--- I thought I was the only one who had had bad experiences at Malees!!  We had a terrible time a year or so ago. Rude  unhelpful servers, 
I contacted the management , they apologized , said they were sending a 
certificate to show their concern. Never saw it.  
I love the sushi but not enough to pay for awful wait staff.  I wonder if the economy  or the service closed them  down.My husband and I used to go here frequently before  the problems.
