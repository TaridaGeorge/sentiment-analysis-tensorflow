"No Vegans Allowed", reads a sign posted just above the entrance and narrated by a middle aged man in slow motion usually working for charlie brown. Okay, maybe not, but it should be there. The only thing truly vegan on the menu is the guacamole, so they claim. The pastas all have cheese, even just red sauce pasta (they cook the cheese into the sauce), my sources reveal. The only reason I find myself at Oregano's is if one of my friends is getting a melted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it, which, to be honest, looks delicious.
