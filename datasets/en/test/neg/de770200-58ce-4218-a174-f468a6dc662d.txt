Lets start with this, We ordered 1 lechon kawali, 1 sisig, and one bulalo soup with a gulaman drink and spent $57!!!? You still there?... ok, each item costs $15 each plus tax. and the drink about 3 something, so i dont even know how we got charged that much. We never got our water until the food was almost done, which was 20 mins. of waiting time and never got water refills. Worst service I've had. Never coming back. Ill stick to Halo-Halo Kitchen thank you.
