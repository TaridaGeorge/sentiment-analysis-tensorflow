This review is aimed squarely at the TCBY Fruithead Smoothies inside the Phoenix Airport.  Never have I been so ripped off at a smoothie store than at Fruithead Smoothies.

Unfriendly service, wrong sized order at first, wasn't nearly enough yogurt, too much ice, way too expensive, forgot vitamin boost, horrible bland flavor... this is the worst airport food I've ever had.  Go to a Wendy's and get a Apple Pecan Salad instead.
