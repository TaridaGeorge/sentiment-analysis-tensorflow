Matthew L on the patio is the worst server ever!  We went on Saturday and got really bad food (cold, stale) and received horrible service (had to track down waiter to order, no refills, never came back to check on status of meal).  I typically like the YH, for HH at least, but felt compelled to warn people about the horrible experience we had sitting out on the patio last Saturday.  I contact YH- hopefully they will take some action to rectify the situation.
