A coworker suggested this place for delivery - I'll never order from here again!

The egg rolls are disgusting, the one peice of crab rangoon I received was burnt!
My cashew chicken with fried rice was so disappointing, as the fried rice was burnt with little brown eggs and smelled horrible (could've been the over usage of bean sprouts in the fried rice).  
The sweet & sour chicken could have been so great - but the breading was soggy and the chicken was so dry & chewy...
Not to mention they forgot the drinks I paid for...
