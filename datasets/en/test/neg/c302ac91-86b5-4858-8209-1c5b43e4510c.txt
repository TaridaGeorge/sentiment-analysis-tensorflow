(1.5 star) We have been this place 3 times so far. The first two times were okay. However, the experience from today was terrible. I guess may be its business is not that good, I have strong feeling that they cut cost because its food quality is aweful. 
Pad thai is not the real pad thai. It is very americanized, which means it was overloaded with sodium and sugar.
My green curry is too watery. They must put a lot of water inside in order to cut cost.
Our soup tastes flat. Again, too much wafer inside the soup. Cost saving again?
Service was not that good at all. The male server had never greeted and always ignored customers. 
It looks like this restaurant will be shutting down shortly.
