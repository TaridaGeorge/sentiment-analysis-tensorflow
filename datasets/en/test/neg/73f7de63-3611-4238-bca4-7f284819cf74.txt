Don't go here if you care about customer service.  They are rude and only want your money.  I've gone here a few times and I've left here feeling disappointed.  I was getting my nails done when the tech just started breezing through, I've noticed this before.  They rush their work if they have some one waiting.  They only care about quantity and not quality.  Nails are expensive so take your money somewhere else.
