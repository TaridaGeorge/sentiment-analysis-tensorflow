Worst coffee drink I have ever had and it only cost my $4.65.

I absolutely hate giving one star reviews, but this place needs to figure out how to make their signature coffee drinks instead of handing out a cup of milk with ice. The service was friendly, but the entire time I was there I couldn't help but feel a little out of place due to all the freshman year ASU students sporting their Victoria's Secret PINK gear. The line was long, but they were staffed appropriately so the wait time was minimal.

I knew I should have gone to Cartel, I need to stick to my gut!

One star for friendly, inadequate service.
