the food here was great. i'm glad we just got a few of the smaller items. chopped salad = great! the ingredients sound weird but just taste so good together.

this place completely fails for me due to the service: the server was not attentive nor was he gracious. he was knowledgeable but quite aloof. he wasn't engaging nor was he entertaining. very just ok.

however, i cannot express my hate towards the bartender enough. we literally waited at the bar for over 10 minutes waving her down. she looked a few times and rolled her eyes, clearly assisting the people in front who were ordering lots of wine where she would make more money. 

are you kidding me? we should have just walked out. i don't know why we didn't.

i cannot honestly recommend this place.
