The customer service I received at this location was so egregiously bad I will never set foot in an AAMCO ever again. I made an appointment for 12/31/10 at 3:00 pm about a week in advance. 90 minutes before the appointment, I received a call stating they were closing for the day and I would have to reschedule. In my attempt to get more than just a simple apology, the lady behind the counter accused me of having the problem! Just disgusting.
