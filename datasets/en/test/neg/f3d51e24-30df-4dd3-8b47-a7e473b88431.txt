I was so excited about going to this restaurant but it turned out huge disappointment. My friend and I had 2 salads and 2 pasta dishes. 1 salad was from menu Caprese salad and it turned out they didn't have tomato. And waiter said chef will do something special so I put  an order. Then it came out with chopped romain lettuce. And my friend had special seafood pasta. It came out with way over cooked squid. Chris Bianco should have thought about not open that restaurant serving that quality and kind of food. One more thing, waiter brought a bread we didn't ask for and they charged me later.
