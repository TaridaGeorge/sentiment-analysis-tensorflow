This place is a glorified subway. Way overpriced! I went there the first week they opened with a free coupon and I thought I spent too much on the sandwich I got. What really grinds my gears is the review of someone claiming its the best philly sandwich in az, are you nuts! Personally I like PSC in old town the best, but even Corleones, which is not good by any means, still is vastly better than what they serve at Jersey Mikes. Common people you are better than that than to eat at this dump.
