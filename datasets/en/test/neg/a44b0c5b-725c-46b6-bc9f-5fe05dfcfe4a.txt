I would have given this school 5 stars a year ago, but they are closing our campus and gave the parents and teachers no time to prepare for this. They made their announcement after the open enrollment period for competing schools and now we are stuck scrambling for a school. After over 7 years with this institution I believe we deserve more! I will never choose another Rancho or Meritas owned school!!
