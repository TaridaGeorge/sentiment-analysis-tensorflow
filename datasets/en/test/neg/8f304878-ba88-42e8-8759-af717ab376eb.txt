I discovered again why I don't go to AMC movie Theatres $13.00 for a Ex Large drink and a small personal Pizza are you kidding me !!!!!. I work for one of the larger Banks and people say we charge a lot but this is just wrong when the food and drink cost moe than your movie. I give this one star only because I can't post this other wise
