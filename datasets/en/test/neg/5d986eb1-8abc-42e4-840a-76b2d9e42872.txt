First off, I'm not dogging on all Subways. Usually they'd rank a 2 to a 3 star from me. 

But this one at 16th & Camelback ranks by far as the worst one I've ever been to. Maybe it was because I came at night, because who eats a sandwich at night? (I do), but it was filthy & depressing, I was standing there waiting while the two guys behind the counter were "busy" (I was the only patron in there), and my tuna sub? The nastiest sandwich I've ever eaten, even by Subway standards. You know how you wring a towel to get all the water out? Imagine your stomach doing that. Not a fun night, no. 

Moral of the story is (for me) that I'm never going back to this particular Subway again - I'll stick to Jamba'ing next door instead. Maybe you should, too.
