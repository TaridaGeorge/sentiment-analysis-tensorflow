In my opinion, Hana on 7th Ave. has the best sushi in town, but I just moved to Scottsdale and thought I'd try this highly-rated place.  Got violently ill a few hours after eating here.  Besides that, the service was horrible, the fish was average, and the creativity of the sushi was poor.  Never again!
