The food  was awful.
No flavor. Barely hot. Outrageously priced for what we ordered (and got) and the pie was made over 24 hours ago and sold as fresh (I asked).

The service was below par.
I had to wait 10+ minutes to pay my bill at the counter. They could not get our drinks right. No one checked on us. And no one even bothered to muster a "thank you" at any point of our $35+ visit.

Did I fail to mention the bathroom area STUNK of urine before you even went into the bathroom? If they cannot clean their restroom I hate to ask what else they are not cleaning.

I tried to address the awful visit with their customer relations number of their website and "someone" is always on the phone kicking it to voicemail.

Don't bother. I know we won't be back.
