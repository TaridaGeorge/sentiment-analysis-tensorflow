Caution - do not go in Pasand unless you have a couple of hours to kill.  Service is very slow, surly, and indifferent.  I can see why most people order take-out.  The lousy service ruins any positives about the food.  The tinny Indian music can get on your nerves after a couple of hours as well - they volume could be turned down.  Overall one of the most disappointing dining experiences in recent memory!
