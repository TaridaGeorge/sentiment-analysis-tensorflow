This is the second time ordering from this place and we received the WORST service ever; how else would  receive their menu? They are located on Southern and Power and we are about 1/4 mile past Baseline on Power and refused to deliver to us. The manager (aka Mr. David Johnson??) said that he could no longer help us as it was against corporate policy. I would think 7 subs would make this new location think twice? Maybe since it was 10:45 and they closed at 11 they had more important things to do...
