I'm disappointed, we dine here for a lot of occasion. We ordered a rather
Large bone in ribeye.$54.00 This steak was seared at such a high temp
That it was burnt on the outside and very rare on inside. I  couldn't  tell
You how it was seasoned I could only taste BURNT! We did not eat it.
And did not want another steak. I chose to take it home for our dogs.
When I got it home and looked at it I was pissed. To see it in the light
This steak was so burnt, I would of asked for our money back!
I plan on calling and letting them know. I plan on going back for drinks
And side dishes. We do like this place a lot. But this was the worst experience ever.
