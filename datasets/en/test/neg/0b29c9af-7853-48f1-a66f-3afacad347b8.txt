I have been going to dog parks for over ten years.  My five year old daughter was literally standing next to me, not on the ground interacting with any dogs, did not have a toy in her hand, had no treats and was attacked by a boxer/pit mix.  She received many stitches to her face.  The owner made no attempt to help us.
