Staff is nice, but they don't really care to talk much.. It's not like it was busy (i was the only one there). 

Anyways fries were made from the frozen/freezer bag kind. it was all mushy inside.

I could make a better burger at home on a george foreman. I will pass on this place...

they have the most unhealthiest menu ever too.. if you go twice in a lifetime you most likely will have at least 1 heart attack.

kudos on that part...
