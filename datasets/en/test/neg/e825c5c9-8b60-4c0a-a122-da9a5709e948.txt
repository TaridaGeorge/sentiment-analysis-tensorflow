First time here and the last. Service stinks food was okay but service is everything I think there motto here is we don't like bothering our customers so if you like having ur cup empty and seeing your waitress twice and having to flag her down  the entire time then you will like this place by the way there were not busy. I won't bother coming back even if there was a different waitress.
