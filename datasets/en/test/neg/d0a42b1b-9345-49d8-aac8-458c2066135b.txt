I used to like Gallo Blanco untill they canceled my reservation, never will I set foot there again.   It was a fiedtrip to reward my honors seniors and juniors.   They cancelled the day before.   It is already hard to plan outings for our students since all paperwork has to be completed 14 days prior.   For the manager, chef and owner to do this is a slap in the face.
