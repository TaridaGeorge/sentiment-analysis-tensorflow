Seriously, i hate this location!! They have messed my order up somehow, everytime i go there!! And this last time was it for me! I love putting tomatoes on my grilled cheese sandwhices, and i asked them like 3 times to do it for me so they wouldn't mess it up this time! The girl even got kinda snooty with me because i kept asking....like i was the idiot. And sure enough, i get my sandwhich and no tomatoes! And this is like the 7th time this has happened, so im down giving this place a chance. Im sorry but if I ask you 3 times for something it should be stuck in your head like wow, this person must really want some tomatoes on their grilled cheese sandwhich! Maybe we should even put extra tomatoes on there! I have grown to hate this location!
