I spent almost 500 dollars replacing my tires. As soon as the car was ready i got in the car had noticed my antenna was broken. I brought it too their attention and the manager said he would go through the camera footage to see if an employee had damaged it while replacing the tires. He called me back later and stated he found no footage of that. I just bought my car less than a month ago and I know what is wrong and not wrong. My antenna was just fine until after the tires were replaced at this establishment. Manager refused to take responsibility other then paying half of the cost to have the antenna replaced. I spent another $43.23 too have the antenna replaced. I will never go there again!!
