Well, we can't say much for the food since we never got waited on.  We came in last night, a party of six and was seated, five to ten minutes later we got our menus.  Later we finally got some water, we were never asked if we wanted a drink and the waitress who walked by our table several times never even stopped to say sorry she was busy or anything... she didn't even look at us!  There were only 5 tables seated at this time and 2 were done eating.

Needless to say, after about the 6th time passing our table without even a drink order we got up and left and will never ever be back.  

I doubt you will be seeing this place in business very much longer.
