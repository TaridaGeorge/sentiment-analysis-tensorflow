This place SUCKS DOG FARTS.  After waiting two hours, I was told that I couldn't get a duplicate title because my copy of a certified financial power of attorney was not the same as a certified copy of an FPOA.  Sounds like an OXYMORON to me.  Well, if a copy is good enough for banks, why not for the MVD?  Well, because it is the gov't!  It doesn't make any sense, except that gov't workers only work to protect their jobs.  If the MVD was a business, they'd be out of business.
