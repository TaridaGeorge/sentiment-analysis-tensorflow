Ate at Papaya Thai in Tempe  awhile back, loved all the food. Tried the sister store in Mesa today . Thinking they changed owners this was not same quality of food we had before! Chicken Patay oily and peanut sauce a blob. Won Ton soup old and tasted like canned Chicken Soup, spicy Seafood should have been called Spicy Veggie for lack of clams, mussels and shrimp. Only good dish was Chow Mien chicken with special Papaya sauce . The server didn't get our drink order right but after asking twice for 2 diet cokes and hot tea we got 1 of each! It was not busy 2 other tables besides ours and food came out fast! Thus1 rating I wish we just passed this one up!
