I took my vehicle here to fix a corroded electrical system. This company failed to properly diagnose and fix some electrical corrosion issues I was having; they should have replaced the cables but did not. Two weeks later, my car wouldn't start. To the owners credit, he did take the time to email with me, but ultimately refused to reimburse me for the second tow job - all the while steadfastly refusing to acknowledge that the technician was either incompetent or lazy. I recommend going elsewhere.
