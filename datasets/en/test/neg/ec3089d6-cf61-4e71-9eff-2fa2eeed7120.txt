Don't believe the hype! I heard about their "awesome" margaritas and decided to give them a shot before leaving Arizona. First, the bartender was an a--hole. I asked for the rita I've been hearing so much about and he serves me some frozen thing with chambord. I told myself this must not be the thing I've heard such ravings about so decided to choke that thing down along with their sad excuse of chicken tortilla soup - which had VERY LITTLE cheese and chicken but plenty of broth that looked like diarrhea. After all of this grossness I asked the bartender for the better rita that is not frozen. He told me that their best ritas WERE the frozen ones. When I heard that I got Z'Hell outta that place. 
Can't wait to be back home in Dallas for a REAL rita at Ojeda's and Monica's.
