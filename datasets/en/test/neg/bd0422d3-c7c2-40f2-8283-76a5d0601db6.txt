I WAS excited to see that a jimmy johns had recently opened up near my house. I called and gave them my complete order and personal information including credit card number, in all it was about a 10 to 15 minute call and just when we were getting off the phone she asked me where my major crossroads were. At which point she told me we were out of the delivery area. So basically it was a complete waste of time and when i called back to make sure that my card was not charged i spoke to the manager who was EXTREMELY rude and told me that they did charge and it would be voided. You would think at that point they would send their driver an extra block.
