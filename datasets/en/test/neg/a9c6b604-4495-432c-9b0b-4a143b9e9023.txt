it says 'dive bar' on the sign, but plays deafening techno music to an empty room on a Saturday night. no tables where you can sit with friends. we wanted a dive bar and it's not, it's just a shitty small club. But even if I forgave it for not being what's on the sign, there's nowhere to dance if someone wanted to. So, not sure what it's trying to be, but it's not working. I felt so bad for the bartender, she was really nice. She turned the music down slightly and the guy working on the computer kept cranking it back up. So loud it was difficult to order a drink without hand signals from someone 1 ft away. Really strange.
