Ok, I'm the kind of girl who grew up staying in motels, so I'm ok with your average Travelodge. This place is your BELOW average Travelodge... Reasons:

1. Didn't ask if we were ok with a smoking room (yuck...hotels still allow this?)

2. One bath towel, two guests... twice in the same week, with no apology

3. Air conditioning sounds louder than a Harley Davidson

4. Got back after a full day out (8+ hours) and the room wasn't cleaned

5. Front desk didn't seem phased by this when I called to complain 

I will NOT be staying in a Travelodge again anytime soon. I highly recommend any other hotel than this one if you're planning on staying in Scottsdale.
