Miracle Mile???  

A Half An Inch is more like it.  Heard good things about this place.  Someone said their pastrami sandwiches were awesome.  So, in all fairness I didn't try their pastrami, but the BLT.  The thing came out on white wonder bread (not toasted so at least some of its 'flavor' could have been burned off) with a glob of mayo in the center of the bread with exactly 3 slices of bacon (not the thick kind) and one measly ice burg lettuce...you get more lettuce than that on a McDonald's burger. Speaking of Mickey D's, my BLT came with as many fries as their small kids Happy Meal, which is actually less than a small on their regular menu.  On top of it, the sucker cost $7 bucks...
holy crap, i think i died and went to hell.
