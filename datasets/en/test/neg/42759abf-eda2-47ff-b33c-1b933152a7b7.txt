Sold me the world's worst phone without telling me the Droid was comming out in 2 weeks. Stuck with a Samsung SEGA for another 6 months. Does all tech stuff great. Sucks as a phone. Can't hear, drops calls repeatedly, (could be Verizon's Network too). I can't wait to get rid of it and possible Verizon too.
