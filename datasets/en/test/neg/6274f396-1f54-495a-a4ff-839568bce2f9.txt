I took a very expensive Zegna men's suit there to have the sleeves shortened.  I picked it up and when I got it back home, I noticed that all they did was fold the material under and stitch it.  So, it's very heavy around the cuffs, and they do not look right.  It is a very amateur job, and frankly I could have done better myself.  And, they charged me $25 to do this.  I won't be taking it back to have them fix it because if they don't even have enough sense to know how a men's suit cuff should look, I don't want them touching my suit. i have had a lot of suits altered over they years, and this is the worst job I have ever seen.  They are either extremely lazy, or just don't have a clue how to alter clothes.
