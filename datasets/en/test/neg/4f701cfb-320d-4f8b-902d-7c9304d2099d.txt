Checked the living room outafter we met a couple ladies who said they loved this place. What on earth were they thinking???

NOISY! Staff didn't smile, Appetizers were at best mediocre (steak Bruchetta was tough as shoe leather and tasted like the steer had been roaming the range for a couple hundred years). Chicken Bruchetta was a total waste of time. Even though we were extremely hungry, we left half our appetizers untouched.

With so many EXCEPTIONAL choices like Brio, The Keg, Cork, Down Under and others, we don't understand why the place is so crowded...
the only thing we suspected is that it might be a pick-up joint... lots of older guys and young to mid-age women. Definitely NOT a couples place.
