This location used to be a FatBurger, come back!

I came here with my wife figuring we would get a great burger.
The person serving behind the counter was nice, but that was the end of the good experience..

The burgers were extremely greasy! So were the fries..
My wife's bun was completely soaked in grease making it very unappealing. 
Tables wren't cleaned either.

I will not be coming back here again, visit the In'n'Out in the same mall, or Island burgers.
