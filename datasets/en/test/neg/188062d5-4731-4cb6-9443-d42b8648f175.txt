Do not use them!  These guys are not a legitimate locksmith company.  They have a BBB rating of F for a good reason.  Google "locksmith scam" and you will find this company satisfies every characteristic of a locksmith scam.  They answer the phone with "locksmith" not the name of their company.  They quote a low price over the phone then jack it up when they show up.  They don't show up in a company vehicle.  They want you to pay in cash.

I was charged almost $200 for a home lockout.  After I paid, I felt uncomfortable paying that so I did some Googling and found references to locksmith scams.  I found a few local locksmith companies that have A ratings with the BBB and called them.  I was told the work should have cost $70-$80.
