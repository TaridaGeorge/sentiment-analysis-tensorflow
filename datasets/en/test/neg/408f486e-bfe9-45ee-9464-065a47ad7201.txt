poor excuse for a Westcor pad occupant. See "Waiting" (the movie). Yeah, it's that place.

--grilled cheese sandwich looked like a brillo pad after three weeks' use (see my picture)
--servers confused, unaware of their own menu
--and that was just the content; they were filthy
--service timings all off
--soda syrups not properly proportioned

methinks it's the location. just stay away.
