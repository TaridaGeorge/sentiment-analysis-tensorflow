DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!! They put 4 new tires on my car instead of 2 and it took 5 hours. Instead of crediting me or fixing it right then, because they did not have time, gave me coupons for a free oil change. I brought my car in for an oil change at 8:30 in the morning and at 10:30 it was still parked in their lot untouched. They lack professionalism and are extremely rude to customers.
