Upscale Mexican Food?  Give me break.  From a veteran restaurant worker, the place smelled like a dirty, soggy mop.  Here's a tip, change your mop heads!  And what's with the twangy country music being pumped through the restaurant?  And meat-head bartenders, stop talking about your "girlfriends" and your weekend and get me another beer.  So many questions, few answers.  OK food,  cool new restaurant, never again.
