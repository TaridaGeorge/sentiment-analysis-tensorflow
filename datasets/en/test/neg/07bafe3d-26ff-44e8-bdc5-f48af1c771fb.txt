I know lots of people love this place, but I had the WORST blueberry pancakes I've ever had here.  

You know when you just have a jonesing for nice fluffy pancakes and you HAVE to get a fix?  Well, sadly I made the mistake of coming here.

The blueberries were *tiny* and the blueberry compote on top had a nasty saccharin-ish taste to it.

The service?  Uh, forget it.  We waited about 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  

I see the lines of people waiting outside on my way to church on Sundays, but I just don't get the appeal.
