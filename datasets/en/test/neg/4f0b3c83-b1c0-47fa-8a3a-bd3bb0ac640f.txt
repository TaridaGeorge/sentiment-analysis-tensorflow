Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.  Is there REALLY even a Leonard that works there?  Leonard goes to work and then takes an 8 hour break.  I called Staples to follow up on a print order and he told me he was going to have to call me back because it was time for his break.  I then went to the store and ole Leonard was too busy on his cell phone to help me.  The only upside to this place is the nice female that works in the copy/print center.
