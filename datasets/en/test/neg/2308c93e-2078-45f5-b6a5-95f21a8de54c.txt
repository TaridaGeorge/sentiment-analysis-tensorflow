Although the people/Drs are friendly, they seem too busy to care about the patients. Be prepared to be treated like a number-an insurance claim number. I went here for several years and had numerous bad experiences, but was just too lazt to switch Dr's through my insurance. My complaints are:*Was given the wrong prescription several times - sometimes they werent even mine!*Was given incorrect/incomplete lab results-The nurse didnt know how to read them!*Prepare for a long wait. Even if you make an appointment, you can wait an additional hour. Not sure of the purpose of the appointment.*Watch for bugs. I found a small scorpion crawling up the wall of one of the rooms i was in.*Just found out my Dr left the practice and i was never informed! Im sure they will expect me to come in to renew my prescriptions now $$$$$*They never return phone calls/messages.
