Needing a wheel bearing to be pressed on the front hub assembly of my vehicle, I was sent to this location as having the correct press to complete this end. After approaching a store representative and explaining my need, I was turned away. I contacted the person who sent me, and he said "it must be a mistake", and recommended I return to inquire again. I did, and asked some harder questions. In the process, I caught the man in a lie and called him on it. He then became confrontational, and I took my business elsewhere.
