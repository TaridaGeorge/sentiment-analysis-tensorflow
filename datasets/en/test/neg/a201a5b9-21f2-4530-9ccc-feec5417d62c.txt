The homeless seem to want to use the restrooms here, so the rest of us have to find an employee and get one of their coins to gain access to the restroom.  Even worse, they changed the policy recently to open access with a stern reminder that if you don't keep the restroom clean, then they'll revert back to their old policy.  Great... the restroom saga continues....

For a two story location they're a little short on selection in some areas, and there's a parking problem like there is for all merchants in downtown Tempe on Mill ave.
