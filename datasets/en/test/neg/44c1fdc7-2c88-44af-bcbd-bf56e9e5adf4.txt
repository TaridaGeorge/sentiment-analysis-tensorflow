I have been calling around to various bakeries around the Valley about Wedding Cakes. I have gone in before to buy little cookies and cakes because they are close to my work and they were alright. I think they are a little over priced for what you get. But the reason why I give them one star is that the customer service was HORRIBLE! If I am going to be spending close to $1,000 dollars on a wedding cake for 200 people I not only expect that the food should taste great, but that the customer service is better than that. Just because you have a cake on the front of Arizona Bride does not mean the customer service goes out the window. Needless to say I will be going somewhere else who wants to work with me.
