I went here for a Comfort for Change and AAF concert a couple of weeks ago. I really didnt like the venue. I was really disappointed that they allowed moshing. I think its fine normally if its in a defined area. However the bruises on my legs are just now fading from the kicking and punching I received while trying to avoid the mosh pit. The security was very lax and was not there to protect anyone, especially people who were not moshing. Its hard to enjoy a concert if you are so busy trying not to get stepped on or shoved. I will not be going back here!!!

P.S. bathrooms were not well maintained and were very dirty.
