Typical strip mall chinese restaurant where they have 800 things on their menu but could probably give you 800 reasons not to go back.

The tiny plate and whimpy plastic utensils made it close to impossible to make the best of the below average food.

I wanted to stick my fingers down my throat when I walked out the door. 

I ordered the L29, but it didn't resemble any L29 I've ever had before.
