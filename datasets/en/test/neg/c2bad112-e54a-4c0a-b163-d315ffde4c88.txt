My family and I had a horrible experience here in June.  We were visiting from D.C. and our mother took us here because of all the rave reviews.  I was 7 months pregnant at the time, and also brought my two young children.  The staff was very rude and even asked me to wait outside for our table, the restaurant was NOT crowded and I asked to sit at the bar to wait because I was uncomfortable, but was told I could not.  Furthermore, the pizza was not worth any wait!!  Oregano's  pizza is better and the service/staff are outstanding compared to snobby  Pizzeria Bianco!!
