Wow... ate here on 4/17, and was really looking forward to it, but Moira struck out on all fronts when it came to the sushi.  I loved the look of the place when we walked in, and hopes were high, until we started eating.  The service was sub-par, as were the drinks, and then came some of the poorest quality sushi I've ever had... especially when you consider the high prices.  (The Sakura roll - our server's recommendation, turned the stomach with its funky aftertaste).   After reading the initial reviews, did Moira give up after opening night?
