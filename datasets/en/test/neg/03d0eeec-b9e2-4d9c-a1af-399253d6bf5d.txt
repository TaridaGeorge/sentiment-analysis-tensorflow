Home of the $30,000 millionaire, fake breasts, fake calves, fake lips hips and faces. Scottsdale is a ridiculous town full of places that take themselves too seriously and people that think their chain restaurants are 'quirky' and interesting. 

Also, for some reason, they have decided that a lagging left is a better option than a leading. As if having all those extra cars at the intersection for a longer period of time is better for everyone. Secretly I think the reason that they want those making lefts to go last is because of the ties to left and sinister behavior. Only the poor have to go left, they must be punished for being poor. 

Each day that I enter Scottsdale I die a little inside.
