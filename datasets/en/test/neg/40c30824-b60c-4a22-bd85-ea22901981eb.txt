WARNING:  DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!!   We paid for one of those $200 details, 6 hours later and at closing time the truck wasn't finished.  Regardless, and unbeknown to us, we took the truck home.   There were so many things not washed or cleaned... it was ridiculous.  The next day we took the truck for a redo... after 4 hours, still dirty.  Dirty windows, gum in the truck bed, same old coffee spill still in the cup holder.  10 hour and $200 later.  We paid for a detail and got a crappy wash.

Flash forward... 8 months later.  I thought, maybe, they could do a basic wash.  I was WRONG!   DO NOT TAKE YOUR CARE HERE.  After $17.00, they couldn't even clean the cupholders, a service that was specifically shown on the menu under the $17.99 wash package.  Ugg!
