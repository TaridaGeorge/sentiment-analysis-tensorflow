This is one of the weirdest places I've ever been.  I took some folks there that were in from out of town and staying at the Sheraton.  They have a separate waitress for drinks and food.  It is cash only, and they asked us to pay before we had even finished eating.  The waitresses didn't have much upstairs either.  They offered an all-u-can eat rib special, then told us after we got our 2nd half rack that they were out of ribs.  And who knows where the hell the people in there crawled out from.  Which is probably why it is cash-only, they must have dine and dashers.    Needless to say it didnt leave the most solid impression of PHX on my guests.
