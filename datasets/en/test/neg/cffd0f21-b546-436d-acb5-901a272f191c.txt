If your idea of having a condescending, eye rolling girl take your order & rolling her eyes if you take too long or ask any questions, you'll love Senor Taco! If you then like waiting 28 minutes for your order during your 1hour lunch, you'll love Senor Taco! If you don't mind a half empty salsa bar and dilapidated garnish, You Must Visit Senor Taco! The best part was hearing another customer tell the little urchin off for her arrogant attitude, then hearing the condescending employee talk trash about us customers to the workers in the back, thinking no one understands Spanish.
