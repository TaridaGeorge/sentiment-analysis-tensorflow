Decent pizza, but they told me one price on the phone when I ordered (the "special", then when I came in they charged me a different price. Manager didn't care at all. I called to try to make it right, not really concerned about the $2, was very nice about it, but the manager was not concerned and literally hung up on me when I was trying to discuss it.
