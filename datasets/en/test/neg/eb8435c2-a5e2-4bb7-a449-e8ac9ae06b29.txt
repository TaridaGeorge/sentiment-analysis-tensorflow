The parking lot is always super crowded. People need to be reminded that the red zone in front of the store is reserved for Fire trucks, paramedics, and law enforcement. I can't stand seeing people park in the red zone. Why doesn't security enforce this?? 

The employees at this store are also really rude and treat you like you're just a bother. Don't expect them to even say hello.
