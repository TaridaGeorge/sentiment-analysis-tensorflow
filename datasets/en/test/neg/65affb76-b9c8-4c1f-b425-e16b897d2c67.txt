This is the all time worst place to eat sushi.  No matter where I go to consume some sushi, the most common thing we sushi loves complain about is RA.  The waitstaff is rude there, the music is "THUMPING", the clientelle is stuck up and irritating.  The food is not good either.  They commonly even mess up the Sake.  I always like my food spicy.  The last time I was there, I advised them to make my tuna roll spicy and instructed them on how to do it.  The guy just looked at me and laughed and walked away to talk to some girls who were hostesses or something.  The food finally arrived and it was gross.  I had to kill the taste with a beer and the server took forever to notice me.  I can't even finish this review I am getting so irritated!!
