The owners are Korean, the lady was really nice.
She made eye contact and smiled and greeted us.

The guy... I don't think he meant to be racist,
but when a couple Latinos/ ppl of Hispanic decent came in the store and orders,
he goes "Amigo, someting wrong?" 
I could not believe my ears lol.

The food... I can cook better (and I'm pretty pathetic)

I ordered sukiyaki and my bf ordered bulgogi.

Sukiyaki was just veggies (carrots and lettuce) on top of rice. almost no meat.
Bulgogi was not well seasoned.

The food was bland and nasty.

Was NOT worth the 15 bucks. Would not go back again.
