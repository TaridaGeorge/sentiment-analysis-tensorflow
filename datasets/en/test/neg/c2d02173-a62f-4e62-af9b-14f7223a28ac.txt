Extremely rude ground crew in Phoenix. Going to a funeral. Bumped us from flight. Gate woman (Den**e) actually walked away from my wife who was crying as we were on our way to a funeral in her family. 

Return flight got screwed up due to getting bumped outgoing. Had to wait hours to get a flight together. Closed plane door 15 minutes before departure time on the return.

Worst airline experience ever. Things happen but hiring representatives who are rude, callous and cruel is no way to run a business.

Will drive next time.

This airline's people are a complete nightmare. They seem to take perverse pleasure in screwing over their customers.
