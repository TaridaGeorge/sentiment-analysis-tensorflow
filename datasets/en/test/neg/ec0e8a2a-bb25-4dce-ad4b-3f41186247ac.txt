We went there for dinner and ordered 16oz. Landsharks but got 12oz beers that did not taste like Landshark. Also half of the menu they don't make, I assume this is because of cutting costs; the place was empty at 6:30 pm on a Sat. night. No sweet potato fries, no beans, and didn't have two types of meat for entrees. The waiter didn't even tell us they didn't have it UNTIL we ordered. Not recommended at all.
