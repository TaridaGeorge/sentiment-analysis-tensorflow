I don't even know where to begin. Sat down, the table was full of other ppls drinks... our server told us weird things we didn't need to know.. the food came out wrong... and took forever...they didnt have things on the menu... marg machine wasnt working... was given the wrong bill... not a great experience. I hear if you come before 2pm it's better and they have happy hour mimosas
