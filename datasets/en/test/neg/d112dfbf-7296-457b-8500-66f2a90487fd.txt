With the name Two Hippies I was dreaming of organic local veggies, decent coffee, yummy health food and a environmentally friendly sustainable atmosphere. 
Instead I got crappy Folgers (type) coffee, a 3 egg/vegetable burrito (with scant vegetables that tasted like they came from a freezer bag), tasteless potatoes and on top of it all the food was served on styrofoam plates with plastic ware. 
Overall, it was really cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. 
Two positive notes- the staff was friendly and the decor was fun to look at.
