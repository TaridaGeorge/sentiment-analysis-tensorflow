I booked a room a couple of months ago for an upcoming conference I was planning to attend in September.  They charged my credit card for two nights at the time as a deposit.  I had to cancel the trip because of  personal illness and called today assuming I was well within the 72 hour cancellation window which is typical of most hotels of this type.  I was told there was a seven-day cancellation policy on the room I had reserved and they charged me a $199 cancellation fee (one night's stay).  I've never stayed at this particular hotel but based on this experience, I will never stay here or at any Westin hotel.  Read the fine print if you feel you must stay here but I wouldn't recommend it.
