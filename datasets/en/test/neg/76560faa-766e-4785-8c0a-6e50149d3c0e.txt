omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food.
