This place has horrible service, I'm not sure if they are racist to their own race or what their problem is. They gave us miso soup without spoons, which is fine because some places do that, but when I asked for spoons they said, "that's how to drink miso, without spoons." I don't know what else to say really, a restaurant can't even give me spoons because I asked for some? And when she told me this, she had this attitude like I am crazy because I asked for something outrageous or something. Ridiculous I tell you, I've never been back and never will. The sushi was decent, but by that time I was too irritated to care.
