I don't think I'll be shopping here anytime soon. I bought two very nice shirts that I was only able to wear once! I was very disappointed. The day I bought the shirts I washed them and then wore them later that week. As I was wearing the shirt all of a sudden the beads on my shirt started falling. I tried to stop it but the string they were on just kept coming undone the more I tried fixing it. I ended up just taking the shirt off. The same thing happened with the other shirt as well. I will definitely not spend my money here again.
