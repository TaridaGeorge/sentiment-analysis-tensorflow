I have visited this establishment 3 times and each time I have been disappointed with the service. Great wings and decent drinks but the wait staff is HORRIBLE ! Yesterday I went to Santisi's for Sunday afternoon football, wings and beer, after waiting 5 minutes with no service, I got up and asked the bartender if my table could get some service. I was told someone would be right over. Another 10 minutes went by and still no service, again I asked if my table could get some service, and once more I was told someone would be right over. After about another 5 minutes we got up and left and went to an establishment that acknowledged our presence and provided service. Sad thing is Santisi's wasn't that busy !
