The MAC counter is the worse!!!! Horrible stuck up over made up stuck up associates. I've been to MAC twice and not one time out of the 10 people they have working the counter do I ever get asked for help! My intentions were to go to lush but we couldn't find it and didn't have much time to find it! I had the worse experience at MAC yesterday. I wish I wore Lanc√¥me because that lady was attentive and nice! I will never spend my money at this MAC counter again!
