Stopped in for dim sum this Sunday afternoon. Picked up the following dishes: 

Chinese Broccoli-- best dish here
Shrimp dumplings (not har gow)-- bland, wrapper was not done right  
Rice noodles w/ shrimp-- wrapper was too thick, flavorless, sauce was also blah
Tofu w/ shrimp-- tofu was good, but shrimp stuffing left alot to be desired 
Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves?-- overcooked, only had a big piece of dry pork  

All of the dishes lacked flavor. Tried to make it more palatable with hot chili oil, but that was bland too. WTH?! 

Left very disappointed. $27 (pre-tip) is way overpriced for dim sum.. especially if it's low quality. 

Service was pretty good, but I would not return even though it's right by my house. Very disappointed!!!
