First things first, no waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.
