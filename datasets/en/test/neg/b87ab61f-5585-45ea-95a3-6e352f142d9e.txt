Phone ordered, was told 10 to 15 mins to be ready to pick up.

Went there and was ignored for all the time of waiting: 10 mins or so.

Tried to be very patient and understandable 'cause I'm a nice dude.

But, I realized that I was a customer that ordered THEIR food.

My order was not started after I asked one of the staff who took my order on phone.  

I'm a huge local biz supporter. Oh well, I won't be back.
