Don't Expect customer service at the deli, or good food!!! The old man at the deli had the worst customer service ever!!  I tried ordering a "make your own" sandwich. I started with "i'd like it on a wrap" He snapped back at me "We don't have those anymore!" "okay, i'll take bread. And i wanna make it a cheese and veggie with cucumber, tomatoes...." He then cuts me off and says "uhh, well i'm gonna have to Cut All That...."  "you can't cut veggies back here? isn't that you f' ing job?
so i just left.
