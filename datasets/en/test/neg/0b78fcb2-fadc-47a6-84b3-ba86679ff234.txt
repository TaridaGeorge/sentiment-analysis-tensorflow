I just played the course last week and it is in the worst shape I have ever seen it in the past seven years. The majority of the sprinkler heads are broken and the course hasn't seen water in a long time. They also, are about to loose 3-4 greens that have just started to turn brown.

I would avoid playing this corse unless you are desperate.
