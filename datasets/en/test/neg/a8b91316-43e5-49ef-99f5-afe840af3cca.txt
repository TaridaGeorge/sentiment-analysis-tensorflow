I have to say I have been there a few times before and had a blast. 
This time it was was such a let down. I took my kids thinking they would do what they are known for the show. We got our soup/ salad and in 5 min the guy came to make out food. No tricks no nothing. He made the rice. No flavor at all. The steak and chicken was to dry. We were there all for about 30 min. The manager gave me. 10% off my bill. Not much at all. I don't like spending 114.00 and not getting great service. I will never be back. Over all the worst place I have been to in a long time.
