Ambiance was very nice. Service was really good. Very expensive which wasn't the worse part, the food was horrible. My husband just got chicken parmesan which so bland. The kids got basic spaghetti and hated it. They didn't like the taste.  I got some dish that had Angel Hair pasta, spinach and shrimp. Horrible!!!! The shrimp was horribly cooked and rubbery. Just not good food!!!
