Make sure you eat dinner BEFORE you arrive...and bring lots of money because you're going to blow it all.

The place itself is great.....atmosphere is great.  Small....good vibe.

But, the portions are TINY....and I mean TINY.  I've had Tapas in other cities and they are great.  These are small & expensive.  We dropped $55 among three of us (not including alcohol) and I had to eat after. 

It just wasn't worth the price....
