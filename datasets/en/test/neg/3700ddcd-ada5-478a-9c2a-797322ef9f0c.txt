I despise this place. Cheese curds are disgusting. 
I think this is literally the only place that has ever made me fear that I was going to go into cardiac arrest after leaving. 
I haven't tried the custard, which is supposedly what they are best known for, so I can't rate it on that level, but the food is really gross.
