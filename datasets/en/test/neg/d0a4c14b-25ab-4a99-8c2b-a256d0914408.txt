If there is a ZERO Star rating, this is what this overrated place would have gotten.  In a smelly dumpy shopping center, I thought I was in a Baskin n' Robbins, but that would have been cheaper and better.  I can't beleive all the sheep that go to this place.  Once was enough.  Nothing special, nothing memorial...except for the sign in the window...."Hiring fun, enthusiastic scoopers'.  I wanted to add to that sign..."To replace the unenthusiatic one that is currently working!".
