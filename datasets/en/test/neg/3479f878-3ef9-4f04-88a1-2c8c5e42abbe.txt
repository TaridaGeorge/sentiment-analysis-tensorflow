I know tea..I have been drinking tea for the last 45 years all over the world. I have tried 4 different teas here and they were way way below average with unpleasant after taste. You are better off with starbuck or coffee bean tea. Souvia Tea would be my last choice for "good tea". Very very disappointed. still searching for the "best tea".
