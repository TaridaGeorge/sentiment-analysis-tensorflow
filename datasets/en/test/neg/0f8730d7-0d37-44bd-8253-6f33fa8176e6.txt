This place is like the equivalent of The Clubhouse, in Tempe, but in Phoenix. The layout makes no sense, and the character of the building is incredibly, old and out dated. Especially with as many good acts and money they bring in, its time to reinvest your money to renovate/improve. They pull in great acts but almost always the venue pushes me away from seeing them. Not worth it.
