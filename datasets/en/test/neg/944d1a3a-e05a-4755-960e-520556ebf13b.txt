I would never have been driven to write but after being charged $5.95 for a blended chai with soy milk and *after* having a conversation initiated by the barista of whether consistency or taste being more important, taste being key, I ended up with a milky beverage that was closer to a diluted chai tea bag than it was an enjoyable beverage. I'm sorry that the long wait, the exorbitant price, inconvenient location and bad beverage has swayed me from ever considering them again but when I can get a better tasting blended at half the price in a place like Coffee Bean then it doesn't really pay to go local.
