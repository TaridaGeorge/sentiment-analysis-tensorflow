OMG this place has the rudest staff I've ever encountered.  I've had the food here a couple of times and they've always been on the abrupt side (and that's being kind) but tonight the woman behind the counter literrally YELLED at me while she was taking my order.  Needless to say I walked out and will NEVER go back.  Nothing is worth rude people.  The reviewer below is also right, they're hit and miss with their food, more miss lately than hit.  Skip this place.
