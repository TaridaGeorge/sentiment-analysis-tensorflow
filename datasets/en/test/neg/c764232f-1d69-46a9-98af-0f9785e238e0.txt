I ate at the one in austin a million times and it was always great.  But this was my second time to this location and I'm not going back.  Burned pizza is not acceptable. Flat soda sucks. And server not checking to be sure everything is ok just makes me mad. So I had to post on yelp. Maybe they can fix this place should be great.
