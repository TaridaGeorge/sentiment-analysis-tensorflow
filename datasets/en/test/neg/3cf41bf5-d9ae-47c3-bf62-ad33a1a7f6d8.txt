There is no entrance in the front off Stetson.  You have to enter from the alley back door. Place is dark and packed.  Overly pretentious clientele.  I'm not sure if the A/C was broken because the place was really warm.  We came in and left about five minutes later since we didn't care for the clientele nor did we want to roast.
