We had a problem here with a rude employee.  Unfortunately, the GM is on vacation for the next week.  I left my phone number for her but luckily the front desk mgr called me & I told her what had transpired.  So, we will be able to stay again here next year gratis.  Originally I did say that I would never come back here but I will give them a chance to make good.  Otherwise, the breakfast is ok, the evening hors d'oeuvres were missed since we got here too late.  The neighborhood is ok but centrally located.
