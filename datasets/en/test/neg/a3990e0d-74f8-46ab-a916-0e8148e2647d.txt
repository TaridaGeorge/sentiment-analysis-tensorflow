Hospice of the Valley for someone with dementia. They will drug your loved one up so much that they fall into a comma and then 10 to 15 days later will die of dehydration. Although your loved one's quality of life was zero there is a difference for the person that signed the paperwork allowing it to happen and when God allows it to happen. End of life care is hard on the person who signs and people should know this is what they are signing before it happens.
