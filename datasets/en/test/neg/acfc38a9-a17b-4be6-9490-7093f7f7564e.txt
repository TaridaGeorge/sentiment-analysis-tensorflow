I tried a free class here and I was really interested in signing up but the down payment for a membership was $279! I told the manager that I was really interested in joining his gym but the start up fee was too much. He got an attitude and told my friend and I that we were looking at him like he had two heads and he is not going to waste anymore of our time. I was hoping he would work with me. I wasn't asking for a handout but $279 is way too much considering I can go to Gold's Gym and sign up for $20.

There are more affordable options out there I found Lee's ATA Martial Arts and it's $20 for unlimited classes the first month. http://www.leesatamember.com/
