Great hotel with a superb bar and restaurant (Sushi Roku), but our stay was heavily tarnished by our experience of the pool...

Unfortunately, the W has cashed in on the Vegas party pool idea and lets wannabes who aren't staying in the hotel turn up and reserve the loungers. This meant that I had to pay $50 for my gf and I to lie in the sun.

You would have thought that paying guests would get priority, but it seems like every skank and db in Scottsdale is more important.
