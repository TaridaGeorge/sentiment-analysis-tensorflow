Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.
