Is it wrong that buffets to make you more dispondant/angry as you eat?

I've only had to leave in the middle of a buffet one time before I was full becaues of seriously bad food, and this was number 2.. The food was practically flavourless - the Honey chicken tasted as though they took Spaghetti-O sauce and some sugar mixed in and called it a sauce, so much other food was completely void of any flavour.. The only halfway decent food was the chow mein..

Even the service was lacking - no one asked how the food was or if there was anything I needed.. The cashier barely muttered the amount I was due and that was it..

You're much better off at other places..!
