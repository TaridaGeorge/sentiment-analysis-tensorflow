I went here with Friends last Friday.  All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a "limited" beer list.  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back.
