Ok - went back after 6 months..I mean it was a rainy day I needed a quick cup of coffee and some breakfast before I started a long day of meetings.  I know I said to myself 6 months ago no more...but I was desperate, it was early, and I live next door. 

I got the Big and Toasty and can I say it's absolutely disgusting!  The amount of oil on it seeped through the wrapper and through the bag.  When I opened it up, the sandwich was NOT toasted and the bacon was RAW.  Seriously this place is horrible.  (check out the picture of the sandwich - I had to throw it away after 2 bites)
