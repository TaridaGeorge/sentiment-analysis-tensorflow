We tried this because it got good reviews. So we ordered to pick up, got the food back home, and each container had a ton of watery grease, the egg rolls were also full of grease. And the taste wasn't that great either, I felt like I could have gotten better food at panda express. One of the four people ended up with stomach problems the next day. The price was cheap but so was the food. I was expecting so much more.
