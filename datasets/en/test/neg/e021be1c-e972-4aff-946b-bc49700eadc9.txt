Went for a free poker tournament and was quite disappointed (and disgusted?) in the place.  I literally STUCK to the floor.  It was gross.  Their carpet is nasty.  The bathroom wasn't much better.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't expect a lot from a sports bars, but I also don't expect to stick to the floor!  The waitress I had was great, and the drinks were cheap and strong - but not enough so to bring me back in the future. 2 thumbs down.
