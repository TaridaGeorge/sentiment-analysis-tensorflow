I really do want local establishments to thrive but there may be a reason SoNY has gone out and comeback again. My girlfriend and I went there and ordered the "Classic Margherita" pizza. This is supossed to be the original classic pizza first made as a tribute to Queen Margherita of Savoy on her visit to Naples in 1889. It was made resembling the colors of the Italian flag, red (tomato), white (mozzarella) and green (basil). This pizza we received looked like the ingredients went through a food processer first and poured over the thin dry crust.
