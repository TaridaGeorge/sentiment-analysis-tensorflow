This is the worst place when it comes customer service! We called and made reservations a week ago and they said the could accommodate 20 people without any problem! We then called the morning of and told them we were on our way. We got there at 11am and we didn't get our good until 12:45! The good didn't come out together and it was not even hot! When we asked to speak to the manager,.Beau, he said he was too busy to speak with us.  It got so bad that my manager marched back to the kitchen and asked him to come out and talk to us. He didn't move. We all ended up writing emails to their corporate office and the owner responded. He acknowledge that their service was unacceptable and offered to make it up to us. However, I have no plans of returning!
