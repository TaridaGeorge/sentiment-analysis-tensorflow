I arrived a 3:20a on 5/20. I bought a ticket for the 3:45a bus. It was not ready to leave until 4:25a and it was overbooked. I had to wait for the next bus going my way which was 8:25a. I still had to pay full price- eat the terrible overpriced food and use the facilities that smelled like they hadn't  been cleaned in months in the meantime. I would never use greyhound again.
