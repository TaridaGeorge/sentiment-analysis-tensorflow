We had multiple casitas/ suites booked for a volleyball tournament. 
We've been trying to check in since 6:45pm. We were finally given a room by the supervisor that was already occupied. 
It is now 8:15 and still no room. Left and went back to Hotel Indigo in Scottsdale where customer service matters.

Can not recommend this place if you actually need a room.
