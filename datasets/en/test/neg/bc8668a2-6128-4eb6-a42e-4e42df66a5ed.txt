I really used to love going to this place, even if it's not the cleanest, the waitress is crabby, and the service is crap, but the food was delicious! But now, even the food is mediocre, the quality has gone down the drain. Having to wait 40 minutes for your food when the restaurant is empty, aaaand not even be good is just not groovy, Such a shame, I used to be a regular. Good thing my boyfriend and I have found a new Chinese joint.
