Snotty hostess and a rude waitress was the beginning of our 10 minute stay here. Sometimes attitude can be a little entertaining but these ladies were simply rude. We had asked to be seated outside but some genius had blocked the mister with their umbrellas so it was too warm for us to sit there. We asked to be reseated  inside and that's when it fell apart. They couldn't handle it and were clearly irritated at our request. Add a rude waitress onto it and we got up and left.  
There are just too many places to go in old town. Why sit through this?  We didn't.
