Groupon Groupies Beware!!!!

Good luck getting a simple oil change at this location.  I'm cheap so I want to use my Groupon for 3 oil changes.  

First they ask that you call in first thing each day in the  morning which i did, several times, same answer "were booked" but if you drop your car we will get to it.  

So I finally decided to drive there and drop my vehicle off, this time the guy said, oh, we are not taking any more today.  WTF?  So I asked how long does it normally take if they do take my car.  Answer: 1 to 3 hours.  Really?  for an Oil Change? BTW I drive a car not a Semi.

Hopefully Groupon can refund my $$  from this jokers.
