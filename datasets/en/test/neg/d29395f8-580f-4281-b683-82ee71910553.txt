A date and went to a movie at IPIC and she insisted she needed a glass of water.  I tried to warn her not to ask for anything at "Bar Salt" lol, but she did anyway; the manager kicked her out for asking for free water, wow.  Yep, this bar needs to go down.  Whoever hired these managers/bartenders seem to be intentionally ruining the reputation of Scottsdale Quarter.  If they want an angry mob to march through there, they are doing great.
