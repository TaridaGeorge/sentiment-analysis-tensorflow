I would have given 2 stars, but I feel betrayed by the horrible way one of my fav cuisines was handled. A philly cheesesteak is a form of chi, that no one should fuck with. Get it right or back off.
Also, when you advertise a lemon coke as a dinner, make sure it's not coke with a lemon slice in it. That is false advertising.
