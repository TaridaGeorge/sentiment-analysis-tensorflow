XMAS PARTY RUINED BY GRAND LUX!! You would think that making reservations one month in advance would secure our request for our office party. NO,NO,NO not the case at the Grand Lux.  The day before our party, our reservations-- our reserved table, per our request, was given to another party.  They told us our reservation was for 10:30am not 6pm(their admitted mistake) wait...they said..we don't open until 11am!!?? WTF??  After speaking to the manager he did offer us some cookies for our trouble. Gee..thanks but no thanks. Oh and they did offer to put us  on some high top tables..too bad two people in our party are in wheelchairs...that is why we requested the booths. Very UPSETTING and DISAPPOINTED in the Grand Lux!!!  Apparently you must call each day to make sure your reservations are secure.  DONT PLAN ANY PARTIES AT THE GRAND LUX
