**do not buy Groupons for this business**. Went in to use mine which became effective after 12:00am on 12/28. After my car wash began, they told me that 12:00am on 12/28 meant 12/29. i explained that i was a contract lawyer for years, I know what 12:00am on 12/28 means. they refused to honor the Groupon, and my car was pulled off the line after the totally lovely and nice (it wasn't her fault) desk woman called "headquarters" to get permission for me to use it. She was a doll, but whoever owns this business be advised: i am circulating this experience all over yelp and Facebook.
