I don't know why I keep trying .......I went through the drive through today for some pork carnitas.....only to get home and find their mystery meat version of beef....aarrghh....had to throw it away it was so scary.  Even more frustrating because the girl on the mike made me repeat it twice and I heard her say PORK twice.  Oh well.....
