I took two of my friends there who are here in Phoenix the first time and the service was terrible.  The noodles and other dishes were good as usual, but the service we received from the guy was otherwise.

That guy talked very fast which didn't bother me as much until he started forgetting our requests.  He stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time.  When we asked to split the bills in two in certain way, it had to be done three times.  It just gave me the impression that he didn't really pay attention to what we wanted.

This is the first time I went back since last year (rated 4/5 previously).  Hopefully he will improve his service and attitude or else they will lose more customers.
