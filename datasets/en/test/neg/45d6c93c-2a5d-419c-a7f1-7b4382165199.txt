Ordered cheeseburger pizza and a supreme.  14" first one cost $15 the other $20.  THe cheeseburger was rectangle shaped and toppings were dry and scarce.  The supreme type had canned ingredients! and was odd/sour smelling.  So bad I couldn't eat it.  We  will never get pizza from there again.  It deserves a WARNING rating.  Clerk asked us if we would like some parmesan cheese, and handed me ONE  thimble-sized portion.  This was on a Sunday and the place was deserted.
