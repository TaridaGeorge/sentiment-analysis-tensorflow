My first visit at this theater was for a movie screening. Thankfully the movie was good so I was able to at least put out of my mind for a little while how bad this theater is. For being in a mall with higher end stores, this theater is so out of place. It is in need of a MAJOR make over. On the other hand, the theater does have very nice staff. Very helpful. Unless, it's for another screening I will not be back. I'll go to AMC theater.
