It's a cute little to-go for sandwiches and salad across the Acardia farm cafe which is a sitting down restaurant. The blond girl at the register is absolutely rude, loud an obnoxious. She does not have any manner at all. Talk to customers without please and thank you. She needs to learn how to speak and not bark.

On to the food, the sandwiches are small and a little pricy. Not worth all the claim about the turkey and brie. Just sandwich, slices of apple and brie. You can make it at home.
