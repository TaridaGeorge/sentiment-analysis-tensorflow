I hesitate to review because I hesitate to relive the experience, but...

Prop up your silicone and enjoy the hot mess that is Jackrabbit.

The 'stars that could have been' breakdown (in chronological order of the evening...):

#1) Nothing says classy VIP and bottle service like faux-strippers...

#2) Everyone loves a Mr. Ed smile on a server right? (just go, you'll see...)

#3) Is that a man or a woman?...Best shimmy spotting evah. (ladies, really? come on)

#4) MILF's livin' the dream...need I say more?

#5) You mean Astroglide doesn't count as lip-gloss?...square.

No, seriously, one star because I L'dMFAO...
If, however, you are planning on leaving your "make-the-best-of-it" attitude at home...I'd suggest another venue.
