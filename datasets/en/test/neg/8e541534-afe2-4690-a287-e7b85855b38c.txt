Went in for a manicure, paid 14 dollars and left with nails not painted. Basically all he did was file and trim cuticles.  I think the polished I picked was old and when it bubbled some lady there said it was my nails that made to polish bubble up! He took color off, tried again...same thing. I asked for clear and he didnt even get all the color polish off....I will never go back...the lady was so rude to me.
