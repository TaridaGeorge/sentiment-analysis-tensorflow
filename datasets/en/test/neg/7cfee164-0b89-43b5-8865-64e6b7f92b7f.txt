This place sucks, simply put.  Older venue with narrow hallways, a bitch to get a drink or beer, can hardly walk around the lines of people in the way.  Everything else is what you would expect from an older covered basketball stadium.  The acoustics sound pretty good concert wise.  I always wish concerts were elsewhere - dodge, cricket, jobing.
