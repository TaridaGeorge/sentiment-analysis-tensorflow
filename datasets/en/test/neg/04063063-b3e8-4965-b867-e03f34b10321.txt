The food wasnt bad but I have made burgers that taste the same on my own grill.  Serving average burgers wouldnt be so bad if the atmosphere was fun or gave you a happy feeling but that wasnt the case either.  I really dont see what the big deal is here.  30 dollars for a couple to eat and your burger is small.... Sorry I wont be going back.
