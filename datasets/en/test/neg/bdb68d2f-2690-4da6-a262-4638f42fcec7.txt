I've been here 3 times and each time the staff was rude and the wait very long.. Trying to give them a fair chance but today was last straw, got eyebrows waxed and I have skin ripped off my eyelids...it is horrid. Tell me they didn't know this... I get red all the time so didn't notice at first but I'll never go back
