please avoid going there 


please do not go there. salesperson was too rude. i was talking to the salesperson, we were excited that we got approved, so the conversation was on speaker. salesperson talked like he just escaped from prison. scott odgie. we ended up not buying the car when we found out that the car is not as described and hidden fees were too much and probably illegal. we have reported them to their supervisor, but be careful. when you buy because a lot of facts wont be disclosed about financing and dealers fee, and make sure you avoid this dealer even though you think you are getting a good deal.
