This Courtyard Marriott singlehandedly cheapened my image of the Marriott brand. 

Slow draining tubs, worn out fixtures, renovation dust, musty smells, and chaotically placed hand written signs guiding to the make-shift front desk as the lobby is being renovated make this a not-visit-again.

$169/night? I've had better rooms for $39. You would do much better at a Super8, or Motel6. Same free wifi, and at least you would get a free cup of passable coffee and a styrofoam flavored waffle.

And the train tracks 1/2 block away make it a noisy sleep.

So all of the things I look for in a hotel - failed.
