My car had been  totaled, I had my settlement and was ready to buy a car.  They had a car I was very interested in and I drove out there on a Friday night.   The receptionist waved her hand and said that the car I was looking for was "somewhere" outside and she would help me but needed to find someone to cover the reception area.  I wandered the lot for about 10 minutes and finally found the car I was looking for.  Looked it over and still no one to assist me.  waiting, waiting.... Went back inside and the receptionist was chowing down food and told me that she still had to wait before she could help me.  Wow!  How do they sell cars?  Needless to say, I went elsewhere and found a great car.
