We just received a discharge letter for our chapter 13 bankruptcy after working hard for 35 months to pay off all our debt...and now the junk mail is piling in...to help us get back in debt again...duhh.

This is an ABUSE of public record and companies like Riverside Nissan, who is the first offender in the barrage of junk mail, should be ASHAMED of themselves for sinking so low.

Luckily my husband and I became aquainted with Dave Ramsey during our Bankruptcy Blues, and will hopefully not make the same mistakes of purchasing large ticket items we can't afford again...CASH IS KING, Baby :)
