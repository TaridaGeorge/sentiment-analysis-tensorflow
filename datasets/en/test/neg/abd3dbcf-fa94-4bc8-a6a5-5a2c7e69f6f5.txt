Learned a lesson on my recent visit...ASK and CONFIRM the price before having the service done...OR you'll end up with all sorts of $5 extras here and there that they tacked onto your bill.

After all of these years of coming to Nail Depot, I WON'T come back here again! This is a very dishonest and desperate way to suck an extra $10 from a regular customer. Sad.

There are Nail Salons on every street corner, I'm sure I won't have problems finding a new place to spend my dollars for nail service.
