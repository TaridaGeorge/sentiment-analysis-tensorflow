We had a meeting scheduled for Capistrano's to supply our restaurant with bread and buns.  We waited over a half an hour before deciding we would need to reschedule.  Later, after we left, the gentleman we had a meeting with called us.   Instead of apologizing for wasting our time, he proceeded to blame us for being late when we were 5 minutes early!  After that failed, he tried to blame the receptionist who tried at least 3 times to call his office, twice on his cell phone, and even sent him and E-mail!  Apparently, Capistrano's has all the customers it needs and isn't really looking for more.  Take your business elsewhere.
