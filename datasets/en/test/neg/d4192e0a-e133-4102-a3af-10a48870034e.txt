What a dump.

My recent experience at the Marquee Theatre was essentially like every other reviewers.

-Slow security with bad attitudes
-Take my shoes off?  Really?
-Weak, overpriced drinks
-Dirty nasty venue
-Rude ass police outside
-Just plain trashy

In the immortal words of Danny Glover, "I'm getting to old for this $h*t."
