Service was horrid!  When a party calls with a reservation and you confirm said reservation they should not be told to either sit outside or wait for an additional thirty minutes before being seated.  (This is after a 20 minute wait past the reservation already.)  All food was either overcooked or undercooked.  Some meals were not even brought out until after other party members had already fisnished.  Trying to flag down a waiter for a refill on a water was nearly impossiable.  I realize that it is not the wait staff's fault but rather poor management.  In the future I will stick to a less pricey better tasting cajun option.
