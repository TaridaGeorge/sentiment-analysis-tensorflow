Went here for a cool treat on a hot night.  We usually go to Yogurtini, but Yoppi is so close to home we thought we would give it a try.  From the moment we walked in the door, everything had the "yuck" factor.  We weren't greeted upon entering, the floor was filthy, all the empty tables were dirty, several of the topping dispensers were empty, the topping counter was a dirty disgrace, there were no sample cups, the ice cream dispensers were filthy, and the two female employees were standing behind the counter talking to each other and doing nothing.  The yogurt was just so so.  We will not be back.
