The food is ok if you're disparate.  It' usually pretty greasy so I don't go there often.  I'm sick of the attitude of the girls behind the counter.  Vary arrogant and they always seem angry.  Honestly, I seriously feel like I'm not welcome there because I'm not hispanic.  You have to beg for salsa.  The place is always full of derelict punk teens constantly throwing the ef word around and spitting.  Go to Taco Bell up the street, yes the food is actually better. They also need to clean the place up.  Went there today and it was bad.  I won't be going back.
