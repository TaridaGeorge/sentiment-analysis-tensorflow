I have been here on 2 different occasions and have been pretty well ignored. I waited between 15-20 minutes just to be helped at the counter. The men behind the counter were chit-chatting with their other (male) customers about topics you'd expect to hear about in a more social situation. It was all very awkward and uncomfortable for me. I can understand a wait, but, on 2 separate occasions, I had to wait for the "social hour" to be over before I was even approached. I went back the second time because I thought I'd been overreacting from first visit. Nope. I will go elsewhere.
