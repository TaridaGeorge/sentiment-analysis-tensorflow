I have given this place 3 chances. First time I ordered Meatball Sub Platter to go. The salad was great, side pasta was good, main dish Meatball Sub was forgotten. Second chance ordered Stromboli Roll to go. Waited 30 mins roll came out and they burned it so I had to wait another 20 mins. got the food back to my work. It was complete dough they came back to replace the roll said it would be 15 mins turned out to be another 45 mins. Finally tried Meatball Sub again. Meatballs were not cooked and sub some cold. Gave up and left. I wish this place was up to par, maybe they can't handle the crowds. The flavor of the food is good but I gave them enough chances and not one good experience =(
