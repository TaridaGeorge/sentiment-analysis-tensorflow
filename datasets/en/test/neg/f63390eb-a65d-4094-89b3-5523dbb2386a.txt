I LOVE the concept.  It's close by.  The owner is a nice guy.  But there's a huge problem here, as others have opined - the burgers are HORRIBLE.  The bun is disgusting (if you can't even get the bun right, that's pretty sad) and the fried burger patty is bland, fatty, greasy, and not the least bit appetizing.  The fries are OK, helped taste-wise by the fact they're cooked in lard.  But they're nothing to write home about.  Everything else is all about the gimmick.. beer, booze, broads, cigarettes.  The burgers are EXPENSIVE.  Sorry, but I just can't come back.  If the burgers were even half-decent, I think this place would be a huge success.  But they're not, and I'd bet that repeat business is not nearly what it could be.
