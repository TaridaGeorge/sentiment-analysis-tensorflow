You know you are in a bad section of town when the greeter at the Walmart doesn't even smile back at you or say "Welcome to Walmart!" when you walk in.  I mean, they get PAID to do that!   And I always smile and say hi to them.

Nor was the cashier in any way friendly when I checked out.  I only went here because the very nice gal at the one on Rural said this one had a bigger inventory and might have what I was after.  I'll never go back here unless enough time goes by that I forget this bad experience.   

No wonder this place has such bad reviews.
