The customer service is absolutely terrible.  I have been there 3 times now, giving it a fair chance, and each time the employees were rude.  I went tonight to try and redeem a groupon and they said that they did not accept it and that groupon had made a mistake.  There were no exceptions.  NOT how a small business should be run.  I will not be back
