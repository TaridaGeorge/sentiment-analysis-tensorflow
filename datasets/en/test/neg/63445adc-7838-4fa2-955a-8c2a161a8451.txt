My hubby was hungry after having a few drinks so we went out looking for something to eat. Everything was closed since it was past 11pm, except for fast food, so that was pretty much our only option. Hubby insisted on going to Burger King & got himself the chicken nuggets meal & for me the chicken fries meal. He was pretty tipsy so he downed his whole meal, but I was sober as can be & could only stomach about half. The fries were barely warm & way too crunchy. The chicken fries were so thick w/coating & just overall disgusting. The sweet & sour sauce I got w/them didn't help either, way too sugary sweet. Needless to say, if my hubby insists on coming here again out of drunkenness I am not ordering anything!
