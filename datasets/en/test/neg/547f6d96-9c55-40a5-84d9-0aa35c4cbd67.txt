I went in looking for good quality massage lotion...ummm....I ran out of there! It reminded me of a yard sale! There wasn't a lot of anything to choose from. A lot of the bottles looked previously opened or used??? 
I know its "down town" but COME ON!! I don't want to feel like I'm being ripped off PRIOR to buying anything. Well, Dollar Tree has this place beat!
