Chinese food in Phoenix  is getting an even worse rap from many of these huge buffets serving bland, tasteless, horrible food that passes for Chinese!  This place is now called Super Moon Buffet but the food remains the same boring, tasteless, fare. I can't go back and waste money there....not when there several Thai and Vietnamese restaurants nearby serving the freshest and most flavorful food around! Will the owners of this buffet please stop the charade??
