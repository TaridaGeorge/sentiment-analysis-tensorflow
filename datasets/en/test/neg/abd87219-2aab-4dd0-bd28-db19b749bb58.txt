Not good.  The whole wheat pancakes are ok, but for that to be your only batter option sucks.  The only condiments on the table are jelly and sugar.  They brought out ketchup in this tiny silver container, which only amounted to 1 spoonful.  The hash browns were dreadfully undercooked and nasty.  I asked for coffee when we ordered and did not get it until I was almost completely done eating.  The eggs were like little yellow bricks.  The owner/manager stands at the front with a scowl on his face and just doesn't look pleasant at all.  

The only positives were we got seated very quickly and the waitress was very nice and pleasant.  Other than that, just not good.  If ever in the area again, I would not go back.
