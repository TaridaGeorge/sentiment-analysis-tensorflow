Stopped in for a beer after the game last night, the place looked run down and very blah.  There was maybe a handful of people sitting at the bar and the bartender walked by us probably 4 times without saying anything.  Served the guests next to us and still didn't greet my group.
He made a comment about the Phillies hat  I was wearing and walked past(he had a braves hat on). We got up and left after about 10 mins went by.  The "New" Jacksons on 3rd is worse than the old Jacksons, no wonder it closed.  Cant see it staying open too long.
