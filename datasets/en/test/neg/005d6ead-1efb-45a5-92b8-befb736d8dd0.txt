Totally never coming back to this or any bashas store. I had an issue with a very rude employee at this store (who also had a huge chew in his mouth). I called to talk to the manager about it and lo and behold it is the manager with the chew that was rude. So..I go to their website and leave a message in their comment/complaint section. It says that you will receive a response within a couple days. Never got a call back to discuss. So, the final step....a negative yelp review. Sorry Bashas I tried to reach out and you slapped me. Off to Frys from now on!
