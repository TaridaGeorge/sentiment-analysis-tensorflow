We used to go to Teakwoods all the time for lunch.  However, their sub-par service is the reason why I never go there anymore.

Dont get me wrong, their grilled hot wings are some of the best I have had.  

I just cant take an hour and a half for lunch.  I would not write this review if this happened once or twice.  They consistently deliver the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to.  I dont think there has ever been a time at teakwoods where I got out of there in less than an hour.  They seem to take forever for even the simplest of requests.  

If you have time to waste, go check out teakwoods.  They are very good at making sure they waste as much as possible.
