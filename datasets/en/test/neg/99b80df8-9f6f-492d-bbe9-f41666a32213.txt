Do not waste your time and money. There are other good Thai places in town where friendly service and delicious food are standard. Went here today and the service was abysmal - the food uninspired. The music was so loud we asked for it to be turned down and the server just raised her eyebrows. She turned it down and then five minutes later it was turned up. The waitress was rude and I could have whipped up a tastier sesame chicken in my own kitchen without a hefty price tag. Do yourself a favor and eat at Sai Ba or Malee's!
