My favorite dessert is mud pie and we picked this place for my birthday dinner because they have mud pie on their menu on their website. Lo and behold THEY DON'T HAVE MUD PIE! How frickin' hard is it to keep your website up to date. It's the 21st century. Not sure what else is fiction on their website but if you think you're getting it because it's on the website better call and verify.
