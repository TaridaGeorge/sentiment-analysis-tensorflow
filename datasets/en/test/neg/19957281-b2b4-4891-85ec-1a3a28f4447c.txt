Ah, back in the day this used to be THE place to go.  Went back this summer at it was so over.  The bar scene was lame.  The rooms were loud.  The pool was overrun with the worst element of Scottsdale.  I hear they are totally renovating the place... or already have?  I won't be stopping by to find out.
