I've used this cleaners for several years.  They did an "okay" job, and I appreciated the drive-through, as I have small children.  But when I went to pick up my pants, they'd lost them.  They won't pay replacement value, because the pants weren't new?   Seriously?!?!  How does a customer replace what they've lost?  Nightmare customer service, all driven by a nasty owner.  I'm with Paul C -- better Goodwill, than dry cleaners.
