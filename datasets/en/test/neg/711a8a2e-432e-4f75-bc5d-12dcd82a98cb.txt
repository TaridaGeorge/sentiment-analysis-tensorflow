Holy crap - what a disaster.  I can only pray that the ones on the east coast are better than this.  If this really is Obama's favorite place, I might have to reconsider my support of him.  I don't even know where to begin.

Let me just make a list of WTF items:
Wicked loud music with no theme or genre
A bin of peanuts that people manhandle while in line
Peanut shells on the floor
"regular" burgers have two patties
"little" burgers that are $5

Just a disaster.  Go to Smashburger, please.  You'll love it.  This place, however, is a joke.  Also, if you have a peanut allergy, I REALLY wouldn't recommend going in here.
