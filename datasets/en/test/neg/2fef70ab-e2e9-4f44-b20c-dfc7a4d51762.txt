Unfortunately, since this fab store is closing, they could care less about their customers.  They will tell you that you can return something even though they will be closing soon...and they won't honor this policy.  I bought several door knobs for my remodel and ended up with 2 too many (Baldwin knobs) and they wouldn't take them back even though they specifically told me they would.
