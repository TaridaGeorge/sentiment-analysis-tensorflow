Carry out is a nightmare. First of all, you have to wait in the same line as the customers eating in. And with one register open? Your pizza is just sitting under a heat lamp an you can't do a thing about it but wait till the 5-6 people in line go throughout their ordering. This has happened to me more than once and it is very irritating.
