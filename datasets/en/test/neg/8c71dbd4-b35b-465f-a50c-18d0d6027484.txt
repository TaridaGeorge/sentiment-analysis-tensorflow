My husband and I went to Phoenix on vacation and after reading some of the reviews, were excited to try the bagels here. These are not NY bagels. They were awful. I couldn't even finish mine, and I love bagels. I got a garlic bagel toasted with regular cream cheese  - the bagel tasted like it had been previously frozen, it was too chewy and the cream cheese was tangy.
