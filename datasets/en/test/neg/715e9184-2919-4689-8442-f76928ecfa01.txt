Quite possibly the grossest food I have ever eaten.  The chicken lo mien was made with spam-ish meat product-- Does that make is Spamish meat product lo mien? I ended up eating just white rice and soy sauce with egg rolls--- can't mess up fried egg rolls right?  I did have to salt them though, they were pretty taste-less. 

The ambiance is less than desirable as well, our plates never got cleared and the amount of unshowered people sitting near me made me want to go home and take a hot bath with all the soap in the world.  

I will not return to Lim's and I suggest you not go either.
