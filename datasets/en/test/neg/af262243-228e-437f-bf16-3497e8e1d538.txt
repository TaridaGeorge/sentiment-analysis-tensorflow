They use to be great but I think they're under new management. The place needed upkeeping while 3 employees were hanging out talking without greeting customers. Customers needed help and they weren't approached. They even announced over the speaker "your girlfriend is on the line".  They no longer offer the cat food I purchase in a case so I waste my time counting out 48 cans. I asked the employee about this and his response was "the manager wants the cases open" . Location is great but I'd rather drive 6 miles to the next closest Petco to me.
