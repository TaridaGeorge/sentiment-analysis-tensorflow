I really enjoy a nice a√ßai bowl, topped w granola and fresh bananas, it really is not the same without the bananas, I guess they were out if fresh bananas so they just put frozen instead, really how am I supposed to chew a solid frozen banana? 
First time at this location but I constantly run into this at the metro center location too, I'm giving up on this place, for a smoothies shop to not have such a staple ingredient as bananas is just embarrassing.
If I could give it no stars I would, horrible.
