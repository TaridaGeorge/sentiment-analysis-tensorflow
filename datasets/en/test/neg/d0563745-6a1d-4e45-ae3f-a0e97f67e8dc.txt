This is the third taco stop in my recent taco binge. I was greatly disappointed due to the reviews, but then again, reviewers here are either greatly kind or have no taste buds. I only had the carne asada and the marinated pork. The carne asada was fried  and bland and on top of that was sitting in a container under a light, not freshly made. The pork was dried and again not marinated but just bland. The kicker was the salsa was bland also. I ordered the pineapple drink, which was just like cool-aide, no real pineapple like they have at food city. This place is similar to a place I tried when I first arrived to Arizona 5 years ago and only recently started eating tacos again. After this, I might have to rethink my sabbatical from taco shops and restaurants.
