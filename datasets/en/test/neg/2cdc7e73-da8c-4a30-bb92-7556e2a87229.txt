Stopped here with my wife and daughter after hearing a few friends say it was amazing,.........Very disappointing, I mean the burgers aren't terrible but they are not great either Just kinda there you know what I mean. pretty pricey as well I think 3 burgers and 1 large order of fries and 3 drinks was like $27. In and out is a much tastier and affordable option.
