This place is always trying to push their weight loss products on people.... the worst part is that they are constantly advertising employment opportunities on Craigslist like they actually want to hire someone!  In reality, they want you to buy their business materials, and buy a bunch of their products so you can go out and sell them.  In my opinion, stay away from dishonest business practices, they don't care about you or anything other than their own wallets!!
