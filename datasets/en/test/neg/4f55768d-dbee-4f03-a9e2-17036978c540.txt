I would not return to this restaurant. Not so much because of the food, which was ok, (not good or great.) but because of their lack of customer service and unfair price advertising.

Their menu does not correctly reflect their prices and they charged me for fries/salad on top of the price of the gyro. The menu states "served with fries or a salad" but when I got my bill I was charged additional money for the side items. When I questioned it, I was told that was a lunch special. The menu is on their wall and there is a menu handout and there is nothing about lunch specials or lunch pricing.

They would NOT take the charges off, but just kept arguing with me.
