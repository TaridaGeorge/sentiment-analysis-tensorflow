BAD BUSINESS!!!  BAD BUSINESS!!!  BAD BUSINESS!!!!

About 2 months ago I brought my cat in and they gave me an estimate for $100 to do a procedure on him.  I went back in today to get the procedure done and they gave me another estimate for over $700!!!  Their excuse was that first estimate was only good for 24 hours.

I'm out another office visit fee only for them to change the estimate.

Anyone else ripped off by them?  I would like to take them to small claims court.

DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!
