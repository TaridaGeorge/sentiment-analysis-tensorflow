My sister and I had lunch at the DD recently.  We both ordered salads.  I ordered a cobb salad with rock shrimp and she had some kind of southwestern salad with chicken.  Neither of our salads seemed to be dressed.  We asked for more salad dressing.  The problem was that the lettuce was so wet, all the salad dressing slid off to the bottom of the bowl.  Also, my salad was supposed to have avocado, it did not. I liked the location and sitting on the patio, but I would not go back there.
