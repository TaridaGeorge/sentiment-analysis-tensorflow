This restaurant is WAY over priced for the quality of food presented.  Starting with the salad, the flavor of the ranch dressing was off... bad after taste.  The halibut cheeks had no flavor and tasted like cardboard.  The rice pilaf tasted like Uncle Ben's and the veggies were way over cooked and cold.  No redeeming value for anything on the plate.  Save your time AND money... It's not worth the walk downstairs.
