I work downtown, so this is easy to get to by walking.  However, the owners are soooooo unfriendly!  The lady doesn't know how to smile or say hi, thank you, or have a nice day.  The wait staff isn't much better, they must be related to the owners!  When there are so many lunch choices downtown, I suggest you go some other place where your business is appreciated, especially in this economy.   Besides, the food is fair to average at best.  Don't bother, go across the street to Sticklers.
