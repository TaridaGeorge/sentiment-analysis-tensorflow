What's going on with the food here? Is there new owners? The food seems to be getting less tasty each time I come here. The beef for the green burrito is not the same, the cheese (white) is horriible. Taste like cafeteria or hospital food. I hope the owner didn't sell and now some cheap owner are buying food now. I used to give this place a 5 star and now I would have to grade them as a 1 star until they improve the quality of there food.
