This is short.

8:30 PM, Saturday night, calling Giuseppe...."ring"...."ring" "RESTORANTE GIUSEPPE!", "Hi what's your current wait??", "KITCHEN IN CLOSED", 'CLICK'.

Your shitting me right?

8:30 on a Saturday, give me a break. I won't even consider trying it now no matter how good it is, another great example of modern day lazy american business operations.
