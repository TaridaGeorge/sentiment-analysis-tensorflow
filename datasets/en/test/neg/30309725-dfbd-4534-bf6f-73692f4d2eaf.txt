Ick.  I must also have visited on a bad day.  Valle Luna serves up by far the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten.  And I've eaten Mexican food in Connecticut.  That's saying something.  I think the best part was the bean dip (I think it was beans) they serve with their chips.  There was nothing memorable after that.  The best and really only good thing about Valle Luna is its location.  It sits right on the Anderson Springs "waterfront" so if you can get the patio, go for it.
