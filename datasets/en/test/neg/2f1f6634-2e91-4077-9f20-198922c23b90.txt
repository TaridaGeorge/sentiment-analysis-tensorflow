I have no idea about the food or service, as the restaurant was closed for lunch on the day I had a reservation for a party of 12.  They had an accident in the kitchen regarding a fire suppressant system.  I know accidents happen and they had tried to call me.  The very nice hostess made a point of coming to the door and took my name and number so that the Manager could call me to apologize.  Guess what, 2 weeks later - No Call!   Where does a party of 12 drop in?  It was a huge hassle and no call??   Do they not know about the longevity of restaurants on Market Street?   Better step it up.
