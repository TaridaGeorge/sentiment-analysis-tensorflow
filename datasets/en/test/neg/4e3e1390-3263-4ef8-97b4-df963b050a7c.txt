I live in walking distance to this place and wished it was all that and a bag of chips. Really people FIVE STARS???? seriously concerned  for where those people normally eat. This place is not even average. We have tried it 2X and just wont do it again. To be honest i cant remember what we had both times but a pasta dish was one thing and a meatball sub?? not sure. Pass on this one and go up the street to La Fontanella for a much better meal.
