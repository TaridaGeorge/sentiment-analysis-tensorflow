This is a very poor implementation of a great idea. I have eaten pre-packaged grocery store sushi which tasted better than this! If you really want to roll your own sushi there are plenty of instructional videos on Youtube. Otherwise, there are plenty of other sushi restaurants priced similarly, which deliver a much superior product.
