Food was definitely not best barbecue. City BBQ or even Damon's is better. But my biggest issue is the lack of customer service received from the owner. We had problem with our order and when brought to owners attention he basically said he can't do anything about it.  (You are the owner right?). he had a nonchalant attitude about it to. You can tell he didn't care about customer. Most business owners would want to keep the customer happy so they would come back.. Well you just lost a customer.
