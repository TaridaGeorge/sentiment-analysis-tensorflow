Worst service of any Chilis restaurant.  I've been here multiple times and had near perfect results in being seated and then ignored for a good 10 minutes or so.  On the last occasion, it turns out the server was seated with a patron just a few rows over, having a casual conversation.  Amazing.

Menu is limited compared to a regular Chilis, and prices are about the same.  Beer selection is just average, and prices are average with respect to the rest of the airport merchants.
