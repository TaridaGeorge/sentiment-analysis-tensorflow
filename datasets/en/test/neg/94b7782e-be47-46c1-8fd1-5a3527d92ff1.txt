New to the Tattoo world I went here due to a referral. I spent over $700 dollars and got the worst tattoo...the artist ? can't remember his name colored in my whole chest with green...like paint by numbers-no outline of florals....had to go to another shop since they refused to fix or even take my calls. I am now $1500 into a tattoo that still has bizarre green back ground. If you have a picture they probably do fine...for me I was trusting the artistic ability and they don't have it.
