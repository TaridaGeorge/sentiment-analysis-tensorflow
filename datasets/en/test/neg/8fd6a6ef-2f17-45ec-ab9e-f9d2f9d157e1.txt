I was being nice in my last review. But this place is ridiculous. They called my boyfriend to confirm an appointment that he NEVER made but they convinced him that he needed to come in anyways. He shows up, signs in, waits for about 45 minutes after his appt. time (they always are running late), then a lady comes out and informs him that "Oh you're not supposed to be seen for another month", WTF!!! That's craziness. Who is running this place?
