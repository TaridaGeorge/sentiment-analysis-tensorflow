I wish they had a "0" star option.  

#1.  The hostess was visibly sick.  

#2.  As we were getting our food, our son dropped some raw chicken onto the counter top.  As we already passed through, my husband stopped me and said, "The girl behind the counter...with gloved hands, scooped up the raw chicken--threw it out--- and then proceeded to refill the vegetables and touched all the handles with the same gloves."  

This is clearly a health issue and I will be reporting this establishment to the department of public health.  You don't even need a food service training/card to know that you don't touch raw meat and then touch other stuff without changing gloves and/or washing your hands.  You just have to be outright dumb.    

Food poisoning at it's finest!!!   These place needs some better management and training for their employees.  We will not dine here ever again.
