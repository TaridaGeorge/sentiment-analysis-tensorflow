I love Sonic but this location never gets it right and they take too long. I am not exaggerating. They either can't get special orders right, orders are short, take too long, or all of the above. I usually get suckered to go back once a year thinking they'll  improve but no more. Last time I went, I ordered a cherry limeade and after waiting over 5 min on the drive thru, I left. They weren't busy or anything. Again, I love Sonic but this location is simply awful. They have serious process and quality control issues that have persisted since they first opened.
