Went here really looking forward to some reasonable food and a great atmosphere. Bombed on all counts.Food was cold and tasteless even after being sent back the first time. Service was not great either with servers running all over the place but none of them actually caring about the people they were serving.
Would I go here again, not if it was the only restaurant in Phoenix. May have Alice Coopers name over the door and this all this place has to offer you couldn't even call it a low market hard rock cafe.
