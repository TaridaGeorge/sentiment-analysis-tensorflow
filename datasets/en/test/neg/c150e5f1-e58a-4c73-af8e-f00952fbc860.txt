I'm happy to hear that some folks out there have good things to say about this Denny's but I don't! I live close by and Denny's usually has great breakfast, it's safe and you know what your getting however; this location breaks the norm. I've given it the benefit of the doubt so many times, but no more. 

    Slow Service
    Cold food
    Incorrect orders
    If you like hot tea....good luck getting more hot water
    The staff doesn't check on you after receiving your meal
    No WiFi service
    Dirty silverware

I dislike this Denny's so much that I actually logged in to write about it. The last time I did this was years ago. THEY SUCK.

A discriminating foodie.
