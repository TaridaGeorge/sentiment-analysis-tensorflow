Was so hungry came across this place while walking to the mall. The wonton soup was hideous.  The broth was decent, but the wonton another story. The wonton wrap was way too thick, very overwhelming and the stuffing had no flavor.

Hot Spicy Szechuan Lobster: for it being $22 it tasted like crap too much badder, can't even taste the lobster. 

Sizzling Black Pepper Beef: presentation was nice, however the beef was super dry. It actually tasted like old meat. I even think Panda Express meat taste better and it's 1/3 of that price.
