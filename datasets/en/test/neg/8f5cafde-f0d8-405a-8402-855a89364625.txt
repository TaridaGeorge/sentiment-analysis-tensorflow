RA is the worst place to go for sushi. They are owned by the Benihana corporation... so that should explain everything. RA is the Samauri Sam's for sushi. Test kitchen prepped with a marketing team to sell food based on quirky names for different rolls.

This RA is located in a shopping complex next to a movie theater. They have a decent bar and a great happy hour drink menu. That's about it. Don't eat there. Their fish doesn't taste very fresh and their rolls... well, they come out looking so fancy. But that's it. Just a pretty face. 

Prices are a little steep considering they serve 2nd rate sushi. You can find fresher tastier rolls at Safeways.
