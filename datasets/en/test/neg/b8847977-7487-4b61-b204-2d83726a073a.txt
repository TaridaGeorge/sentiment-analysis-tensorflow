The food was generally awful. The sweet potato fries were the only good thing I ate. The chicken sandwich I ate was very dry, and service was not the best. What should have tipped me off was all the other restaurants around were filled and had 20 to 40 minute waits, but Coal Burger wasn't even half-full. Won't return to this place ever. They should cut there loses and close their doors and let another business have a shot here in the Scottsdale Quarters.
