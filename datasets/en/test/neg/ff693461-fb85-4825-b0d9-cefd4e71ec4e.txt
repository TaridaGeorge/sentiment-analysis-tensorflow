We just moved back into the hood from Anthem and man what a BUMMER this Safeway is. I LOVE LOVE LVE LVE LEV LOVE LOOOOVE Safeway. I will drive any distance to shop at a Safeway - what a bummer this is only 1/2 a mile from my house. 

Went last night and was utterly appalled at the mess of a store I walked into. The aisles were a disaster - product was thrown everywhere or was completely out. I thought this was a grocery store? A place to buy FOOD?

One checkout line open and a miserable employee ringing. If I wasn't in the middle of baking dessert at home I would have tossed the ingredients I needed back on the shelves and gotten the hell outta there. 

Thank GOD the Safeway on Osborn is only a short ride away.
