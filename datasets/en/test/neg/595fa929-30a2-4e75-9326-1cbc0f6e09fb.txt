Very dirty! I've seen a waitress brush her bangs over the parfait counter in the kitchen, I've seen a waitress transfer pancakes to another plate with her bare hands, also pick up a dropped pancake from the floor (but don't worry, she checked to make sure there wasn't anything on it). Another waitress coughs all the time in the back kitchen, she doesn't cover her mouth or wash her hands.
