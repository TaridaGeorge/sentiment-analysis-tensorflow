The used car dealership of dentistry.  I felt like a medium for their fleecing of the insurance company.  They refused to clean my teeth after I refused their up-sale to a costly (and unnecessary) procedure.  Also, the dentist didn't have the guts to face me himself and tell me this...they sent in the receptionist.  Not even a hygienist.  

I recognize at least 1 of these "5 star" reviews as an employee.  Avoid at all cost.  Find a dentist committed to quality health care and not extracting the absolute maximum from the insurance company.  This place is what is wrong with health care in this country.
