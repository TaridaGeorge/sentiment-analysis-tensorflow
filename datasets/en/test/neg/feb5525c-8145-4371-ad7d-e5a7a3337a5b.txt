I ate at Iruna I succumbed to severe stomach pains and ended up with diarrhea. This left me with a severe distaste for the restaurant and I don't think I could ever recommend such an experience to any of my friends or family. My dining experience at Iruna was on a weekday, Wednesday(7/21), around 8:00 PM. My girlfriend and I enjoy tapas on a frequent basis, and we previously went to Lola Tapas quite a bit before it recently closed down. We decided to try out Iruna, and we ate the gambas al ajillo, trout with salsa navarra, pil pil(halibut special), and filet mignon. Everything was good except the filet mignon, which was overcooked. The service was decent, and it was everything you'd expect from a Scottsdale restaurant.
