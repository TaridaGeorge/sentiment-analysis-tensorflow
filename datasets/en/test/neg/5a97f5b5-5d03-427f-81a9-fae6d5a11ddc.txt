Let's make this short if you want bad food and to be nickeled and dimed to get a shred of  vegetables at 50cents each this is the place to go. If not move on I have. Look at the pictures on the wall of the food that is the only time you will see it look anything like that. If you want Kung Pao 2 you get nothing but the meat and an overload of sauteed onion, not a nut or chili to be found. The egg drop soup was so watered down it was clear and tasteless. This is long enough.
