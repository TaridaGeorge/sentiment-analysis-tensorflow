This was a horrible restaurant.  I will not return to this place again.

I bought a sesame chicken meal.  The actual chicken they used was pretty cheap.  It actually had the texture of leather.  It was horrible, and I found Pong Pong as a much better alternative for cheap chinese food.

If I want something that is really worth my money, I will eat at P. F. Chang's China Bistro.
