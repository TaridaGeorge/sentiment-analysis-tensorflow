First and foremost my friends and I used to absolutely love this place but after a recent breakfast there I will never go again.  Working nights sometimes you just want a great mimosa or bloody mary and some breakfast but that can no longer be found at My Florist.  The food is mediocre at best and the wait staff is just plain rude.  What a shame that such a great place has turned this corner.
