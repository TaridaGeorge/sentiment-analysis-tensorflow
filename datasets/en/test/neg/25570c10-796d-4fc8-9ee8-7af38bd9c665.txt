Experienced this place for the first time today. The wife and I split a turkey sandwich on an onion roll. $8.50 for the blandest turkey sandwich I've ever had. The swiss cheese had no flavor at all. The Tomato was practically non-existant. I could go on.

If I had to actually wait in line for this crap, I would have really been pissed, but there was no wait - at high-noon lunch time - that has to tell you something.

If you want a good sandwich, make it yourself at home before going to this rip-off deli. Or go to Safeway's deli counter and get a sandwich - they are much better, bigger and cost half as much.

I will avoid Miracle Mile Deli until I'm at least 80 - then I'll fit right in with the majority of the clientele - who have no taste buds.
