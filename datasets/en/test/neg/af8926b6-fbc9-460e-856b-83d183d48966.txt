This for the Tire and Lube Center @ Walmart. HORRIBLE customer service. Several customers have left unhelped the 3.5 hours I've been here. I talked to the manager the service was so bad, and I've never done that in my life! A car pulled up to the service bay, one of the techs yelled "fuck not another one, go away!" I can't believe this place. Never going there again.
