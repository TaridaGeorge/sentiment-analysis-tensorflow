We like to compare the calamari appetizer at different restaurants.
We questioned the server regarding the menu description which says the calamari contains zucchini: she assured us it was only a small amount. The calamari arrived  with half squid and half zucchini, and was also rubbery.
We got up and left, and went to Alessia's at Brown and Higley!
If you are in the east valley give it a try.
