What type of bar serves drinks in a thimble you ask?  THIS ONE!  What a freaking rip off.  Sure the waitresses were hot, but in Zona, apparently all of the girls are hot.  Well at least in the .5 mile radius.  They must grow because of the sun.  They probably use photosynthesis.  

The atmosphere wasn't too bad, but it was your typical bar, with typical bar food, with typical douchebags.  Solid one star for the rip off drink amounts.
