Pretty bad. Decor hasnt been changed since the 80's and the food  tasted the same.

Salad and bread = terrible. You can get way better stuff packaged from a grocery store. 

I got the lasagna. First bite was an okay mix of sauce, cheese and sausage. After that there was nothing but cheese and noodles. All the sausage pretty much was gone. It got really heavy tasting pretty quick. 

Avoid unless your taste buds are stuck on 1979.
