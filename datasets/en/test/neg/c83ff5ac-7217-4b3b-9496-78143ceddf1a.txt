Honestly, I'm shocked that you would allow people to view the apartments/ condos at Red Rox before having them cleaned. They were filthy and it was pretty hard to look beyond that. I looked at all three you had listed. #2059 immediately made me want to throw up when I walked in the front door due to the disgusting toilet. #1016 reeked of cigarette smoke and the carpet was filthy. The only way I would ever rent this unit would be if the carpet and appliances were replaced. I also would rather have my own washer and dryer in the unit. I could have been a long time tenant had the apartment been presented in move in condition.  The only good thing about the complex was the landscaping.
