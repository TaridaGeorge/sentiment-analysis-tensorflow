Absolutely hated the two years I went to school there. One of the most disorganized establishments I've ever had to deal with.  No one in admissions, registration, or the cashier's office knew what the heck they were doing.  I was constantly told one thing and ended up having to do the other. The simplest things like singing up for a class turned into week long processes that never went through. The advisers were no help at all and ended up setting me back a year by telling me to take the wrong classes.  

However, there were a few good teachers I met that genuinely tried to help.  Be sure to use rate my professor though because others sucked.
