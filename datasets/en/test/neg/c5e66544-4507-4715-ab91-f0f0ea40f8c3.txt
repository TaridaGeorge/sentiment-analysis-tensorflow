I'm glad to see there are other negative reviews on here as well. The other reviewers are right, the mechanics at this place lie to the customers and invent problems that don't exist. I took my car in to have an exhaust leak fixed, and was told my front brakes AND my front shocks were completely shot. I was already suspicious because I hadn't heard any noise from the front of my car, so I took my car somewhere else. Everything was fine and to top it off, the exhaust problem that Midas found was only a small part of the problem and wouldn't have fixed the noise my car was making.

Very unhappy with this place. Make sure you do your research before believing what they tell you.
