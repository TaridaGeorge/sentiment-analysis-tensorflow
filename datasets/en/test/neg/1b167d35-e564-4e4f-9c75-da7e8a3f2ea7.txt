The customer service that I received today was atrocious.  I was returning a product that I purchased, still in the package with the receipt and was treated very poorly due to the return.  The associate argued with me about the size of the item (a harness) and stated his disbelief that it would not fit.  After my store credit is spent, I will not return.
