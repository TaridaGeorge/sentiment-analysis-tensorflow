Sub-par products (oversweet chai made from powder), inattentive staff (3 minutes for you to acknowledge me standing here?) and dirty environs (flies and split foam cushions). Errr, as much as I am a fan of local coffeeshops, this place doesn't make the grade. I've heard it was better in the past. But I don't see much hope for their future.
