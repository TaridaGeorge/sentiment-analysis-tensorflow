This review is not a review of the store but of AT&T wireless service in general.  AT&T is the worst wireless service I've ever had.  I have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier I've had, and I've had Verizon, T-Mobile (the best) and now AT&T.

I would have never switched service if I didn't have to in order to get my iPhone.  And for the record ... the iPhone is the best object I've EVER owned.  I recommend you avoid AT&T wireless at all costs (unless you want the best phone in the world, only then is it worth it).
