Arrived with a large group - You can almost see the $$ signs in the waiters and wine steward eyes.  The wine suggested was a great producer but in no way fit to be drank.  It was a huge bottle that needed to be moved and we bought in.  The waiter did not even notice the spilled sauces on the table, the crumbs in every corner, or that  silverware for next course was not all placed.  Too bad I had to ask my neighbor for her knife.  No offer of coffee or after dinner drinks.  Food was OK.  But service was offal. I prefer a quick serve restaurant that notices a detail or to.  Did I mention the 18% on an $800 dollar check.  I think I will celebrate some place else next time.
