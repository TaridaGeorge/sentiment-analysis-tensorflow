Decided to spend New Years here and giving them much of my business you would expect to have more respect here. 

Their New Years party said to be free before 11 and a group of 25 of us get there at 945 to make sure that we get in and not have to wait in a horrid line which we end up doing anyway. The manager of junkie and bouncer would not accept their own claim for the free admission like it says on their FB and flier they promoted and they should be confronted on their baiting advertisement which is completely illegal and should be sued. I have dumped way to much money on them to receive this type of treatment. They are all on their high horses and feel like they are doing us a favor for coming there and spending our money...they have it all wrong.
