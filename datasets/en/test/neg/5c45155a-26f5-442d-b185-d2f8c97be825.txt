I work in N. Scottsdale and found a restaurant that I wanted to try in the Scottsdale Quarter. I don't know who designed this place but they must have been smoking something. Parking is TERRIBLE! Most of it is reserved for valet and the spots weren't even filled up. I got so aggravated trying to find a place to park that I just turned around and left. I never even made it to the restaurant. It's sad because I feel bad for the places that will lose business because of shoddy parking. My advice is to park across the street at the Commons and walk.
