Avoid this corrupt company... terrible! 
I sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeeking.
They did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned, the bill would be about $400.00
I said no, bought $18.00 brake pads from another company, and did the repair myself in about an hour
When I looked at the rotors, they were LIKE GLASS, in immaculate condition, absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement...  (the vehicle is only a few years old, with low mileage) 
They completely tried to take advantage of my wife, fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck... they should be shut down... 
You've been warned!!
