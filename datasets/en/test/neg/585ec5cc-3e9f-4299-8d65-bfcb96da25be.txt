What is worse, the horrible service or the interminable wait for mediocre, cold food?  45 minutes for an appetizer that was prepared from frozen and an hour wait for a salad were unacceptable.  Couple that with the surly attitude from the waitress and the fact that our entree was served cold and it was a waste of an evening.  Not worth a first visit, let alone a return one.
