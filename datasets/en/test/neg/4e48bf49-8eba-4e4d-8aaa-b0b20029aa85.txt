My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign " Best Sandwich...." Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market.
