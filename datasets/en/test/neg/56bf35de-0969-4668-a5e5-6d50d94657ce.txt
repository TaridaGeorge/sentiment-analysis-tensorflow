Jesus... what a dive.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just dont expect anything more. Greg Louganis stylee. 

Cheap drinks... always welcome.
Everything on the menu is fried bar food... to be expected.
Walking through the smoking section just to get in... trashy.
Trivia on Friday while the playoffs were on... wtf?  

I thought this was a sports bar!  They mute a playoff game to do trivia??   Why the hell would anyone go here if Half Moon and Teakwoods are nearby?  Screw this joint.  I'll gladly pay a few bucks more for a better bar with better TVs.  Weak Sauce.
