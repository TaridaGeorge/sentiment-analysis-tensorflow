Even if you had reservations for a week in advance and your table is 45 minutes late never ask for a single thing at Binkleys. The owner will cuss you out not serve you and kick you out while still making you pay 280 for small plates of food. Last time I checked at the 4-5 star restaurants I have frequented in Paris, Chicago, DC, Dublin, Rome, London, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Barcelona, and Madrid this would be considered abusive and slanderous . What a shame that a man has to treat customers like this. You never know who you are serving and word of mouth spreads fast among high power doctors and business people. Mr Binkley let me know when you get your Michelin rating because I'm sure that will never happen as superior customer service is a main requirement.
