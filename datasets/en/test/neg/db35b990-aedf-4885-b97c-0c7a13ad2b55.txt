NO NO NO Don't fall for any offers this company tries to make you. Legacy Pest Control sprayed for us less than 2 weeks ago and we had bugs in our yard (the same bugs that they said were guaranteed to be controlled for 60 days) within a week. I called the company and apparently only 'contract customers' were guaranteed good service. I paid $59 for this service and can not believe that it is not guaranteed. Ridiculous and just plain bad business.
