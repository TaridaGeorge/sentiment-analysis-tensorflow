Gave this place a second chance. . . It will be my last!
Pasta was under cooked. Roasted chicken was soaked in a rancid broth. 
Risotto was undercooked and bland. 
Mia must stand for Francesca's severs are M.I.A.
Ambiance is dull. 
Rigatoni was meaty but sauceless. 
Over priced food for Macaroni Grill/Olive Garden quality food. 
Huge disappointment for a neighborhood restaurant.
