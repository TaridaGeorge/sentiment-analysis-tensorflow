CATTLE CALL ?
Ate here three times. The food is too bland for me. It tastes like diet food. If I want diet or healthy food I will eat at home. When I eat out I want food that tastes good. If that means adding lard, or salt, or sugar, or MSG... so be it.

Made the mistake of sitting on the patio once.  I found out what sardines feel like.
