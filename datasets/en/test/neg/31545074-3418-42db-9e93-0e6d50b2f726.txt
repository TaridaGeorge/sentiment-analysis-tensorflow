Worst dry cleaner ever, signed up for yelp just for this review! The ruined my wedding dress!!! I needed to wear the dress again for an event , we had a destination wedding. Went to pick up dress 3 weeks later still not done, went back the day I needed to wear it to find the garment back I dropped it off in missing, the corset string to hold my dress up missing, and the beautiful expensive dress was torn!!! Still haven't been able to speak to the manager. DO NOT GO HERE! Worst customer service and dry cleaner ever....should not be in business. Trust me I am not done with this matter....of all things to ruin my wedding dress!?!?
