I have no clue how this place received so many good reviews. My mom is Italian, so I grew up eating and cooking New York Style Italian food and what came to our table was nothing of the sort. My husband took me here to celebrate my birthday and we were both so completely disappointed. I have never sent back food in my life, but we sent back TWO dishes - I could go on and on, but this place is closed now and it's horrid food is no more.
