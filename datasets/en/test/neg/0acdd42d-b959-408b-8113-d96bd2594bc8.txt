Um.  No.  

I can't bring myself to give any more than one star:  It had air conditioning and chairs to sit on.  The chairs didn't break when we sat on them.  The air conditioning worked.  

Wait staff was absolutely horrible (made us wait very long time before we even got menus, then got distracted when it came time to pay the check).  

I swear this kitchen belongs on kitchen nightmares.  The salad was downright scary (I didn't eat it because I didn't want to get sick), the water glasses had COFFEE STAINS ON THEM (how does that even happen?!), and what edible food there was was simply average.

Manager solicited our feedback then CUT US OFF after we got 3 words out.  (Us: "Well, we kinda ... " Him (interrupting): "Thank you for your business")

Yeah.  If you see this place, don't walk -- RUN to a different restaurant.
