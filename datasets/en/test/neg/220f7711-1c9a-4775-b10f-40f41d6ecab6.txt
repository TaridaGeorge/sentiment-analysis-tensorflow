Be careful with the offering of prepaid Detailing of USD 200. Just when you think, you don't need that much of money for your car detailing and try to get a refund (of the service that you haven't event got yet), they simply say: "It's our policy, no refund for prepaid services...". So be careful, the service is just standard and they're not customer oriented. I'd stay away.
