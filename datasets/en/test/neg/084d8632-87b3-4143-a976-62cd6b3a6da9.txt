My boyfriend and I were on a date Sat night.. Went to stand up live 1st, then after to lucky strike for a drink.  My boyfriend ordered a vodka tonic... WEAK.. So he ordered a double.. willing to pay whatever.. As the girl made the drink.. I did a drink count with her.. (I have been in the service for 16 years) She just put in a larger glass, and did a 3 count.. I asked her about it and she said she did a six count.and if we wanted more she would have to charge for a double plus another drink... girl plzzzz. I watched you...learn how to count!... Rude service!! ! I'll stay at Copper Blues.Thanks
