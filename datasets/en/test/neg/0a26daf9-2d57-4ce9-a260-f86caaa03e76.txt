Just got home from my first visit to BDB.  Look, I grew up in very humble circumstances but this is the Wal Mart of restaurants.  It probably seems wonderful to some folks due to the huge portions but for those with any kind of palate it is really, really, sub-par.

There were 20 of us for a party so therefore there were a variety of plates and I had the opportunity to try several of their entrees.   I just couldn't eat the stuff it was so bad.

Olive Garden is a step up....

Don't do it!!!!
