THUNDERBIRD HOSPITAL: So I tried to dispute a bill with this hospital because they charged me for something I didnt ask for or need and I actually ended up going to the Arrowhead Hospital for treatment for Asthma/Pneumonia. They bascially said we dont allow you to dispute. So whatever they feel like charging you...thats it! GO THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK....I will NEVER go to that hospital again if I have any say that is
