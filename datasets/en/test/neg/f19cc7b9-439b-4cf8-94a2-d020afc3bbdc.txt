I'm with you brenda, I can't either...  This place sucks though and they must have been giving land away to build this inefficient airport.  I was passing through on connecting flight and my layover was 2hrs(?).  The time was 9pm on a Sunday and seriously almost every restaurant was closed.  I must have walked over 3 miles (some moving walkways were down) checking out every terminal for food only to find an open Burger King in Term 1, which was busy and didn't even get my order right.  You would think the airport would have at least a mexican/southwest joint... If you have to connect through here bring your own food/snacks, especially if it's in the evening.
