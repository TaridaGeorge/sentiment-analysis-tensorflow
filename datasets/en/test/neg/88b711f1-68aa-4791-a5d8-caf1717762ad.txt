Responding to Sean who lives in  a unit down the hall.  This is the model my friend.   Did you see my lease?  This unit has never been rented.   I worked on the terms and the lease doesnt correspond with the deal we agreed to.   Perhaps Sean, I am a better deal maker?   Everything that Jeff promised versus what he delivered was altered.   Do you wish to see the emails and text messages.   Do some homework before you make an assessment. Kind of curious how you think you are farmilar with my deal?
