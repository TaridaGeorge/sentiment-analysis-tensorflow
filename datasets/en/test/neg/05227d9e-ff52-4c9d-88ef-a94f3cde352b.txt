Go for the novelty, avoid the food. 

Not bad, but shockingly bad -- easily the worst meal I've had in Arizona. 

To be succinct, everything was pretty obviously done up the day before, then popped in the microwave. My friend and I stopped be for lunch, and against our better instincts ordered food. The meal was out on the table in about 5 minutes. 

Which is, shockingly fast for a restaurant. Of course, once you taste the food the mystery is explained. Just terrible.
