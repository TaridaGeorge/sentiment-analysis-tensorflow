Coronary heart disease is usually caused by a condition called eating at Lukes, which occurs when you eat greasy material at Lukes and a substance called plaque build up on the walls of your arteries. 

Lukes serves overpriced and over greased Chicago grub. The food was so greasy my bun turned into a sludgy doughy mess. I went with a couple of coworkers who also resonated the same criticism. I wont go back to Lukes and you shouldn't either if you value your heart.
