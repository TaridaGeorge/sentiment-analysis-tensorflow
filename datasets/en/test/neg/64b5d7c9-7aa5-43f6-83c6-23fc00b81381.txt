A friend of mine was just talked into joining this gym last week. 18 year old who hadn't experienced the classic "gym" sales crap.
AFTER they accpeted his membership fee and first and last.. THIS GYM IS SHUTTING DOWN in TWO WEEKS!! What a joke! 

So everyone was correct in their previous posts that this place should shut down but they shouldn't have accepted any memberships knowing they were closing in two weeks.
