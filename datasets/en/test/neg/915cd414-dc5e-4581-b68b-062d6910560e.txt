The first thing you'll notice is the large cast iron doors, once you get your bill you'll realize how they can afford it.

They will charge you outrageous amounts of money for unnecessary treatments ($15 urine collection fee? We could have got it ourselves for free!). After treating our dog they said we needed to feed him wet food, to which we asked what brand we should get. They gave us 4 cans of the stuff we had on hand, we were thankful until we got home and saw they charged us $2 per can.

Don't come here if you can help it, and if you do, hold on to your wallet.

The nurses (is that what they are called? The vet's assistants) are really friendly and nice, that's the only positive thing we have to say.
