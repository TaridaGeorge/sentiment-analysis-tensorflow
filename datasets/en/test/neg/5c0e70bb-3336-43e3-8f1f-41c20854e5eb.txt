Overpriced, overrated, and disgusting.  If you really want a good look at Sushi Eye, spend a while on the SOUTH side - they have a back door that faces Elliot.  First, this door is confusing, as you enter the Quzinos there, and a great time can be had watching all the visitors open the back door to face the kitchen.  However, they will simply be ushered through the kitchen, instead of being asked to walk around.  To avoid slander, I won't mention what else I've seen, but I have called the Health Department.  Personally I would rather eat of of the bait bin at a fishing supply store than to eat this sushi.
