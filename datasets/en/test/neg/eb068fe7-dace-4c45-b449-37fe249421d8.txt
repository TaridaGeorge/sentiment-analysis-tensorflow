DO NOT GO TO THIS BAKERY!!!  THE STAFF IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE.  My father who is legally blind with diabetes went in and asked if he could possibly put in a special order for canolis made with splenda and then the staff started cussing and yell at him and told him to go somewhere else.  We will now go to Romanelis in Phoenix!!!  My daddy's bakery needs to be shut down!!!
