I went to this Dental Practice from a referral and it was a bad decision. The staff is unprofessional, unorganized and amazingly enough they don't smile. The appointment schedule was chaos and no one seemed to know what I should have been scheduled for. The Dentist was nice but the Oral Surgeon (Evan Gold) is as unprofessional as the staff he works with. He lacks bed side manner and his procedures cost more than most other oral surgeons in the valley (after doing some investigating). The best thing that happened to me was they botched my appointment for surgery after almost of two months of scheduling. I was able to find a Oral surgeon who explained to me the fraudulent nature of this practice. Lesson Learned.
