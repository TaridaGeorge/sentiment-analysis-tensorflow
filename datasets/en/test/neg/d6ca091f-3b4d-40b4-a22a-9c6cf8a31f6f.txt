Not a good experience!  Our 3 yr old son loves airplanes, and we've heard that this place has great food and it's very entertaining for kids.  We went in for breakfast around 8:30 and didn't get our food until 45 minutes later- for 2 meals!  Thank goodness we brought in a snack for our son to hold him over, because the supposed airplane entertainment was nothing to be excited about!  Not too mention this place is crazy loud inside.  We left feeling terribly disappointed with our meals, irritated with how loud it was, and cheated by the lack of ambiance/entertainment.  The menu seems pretty decent, til you actually get the food!  Tasteless.  And the coffee was awful and overpriced.  We will not be returning!
