Walked into Jimmy John's at 6pm on 10/31 to see a man with a large dog waiting for food at the pickup end of the counter. The dog was not a seeing eye dog, or one in training. Dog had its front feet up on the counter, and the people behind the counter were talking to the dog. Pretty disgusting for food being prepared 1 or 2 feet away. No thanks.
