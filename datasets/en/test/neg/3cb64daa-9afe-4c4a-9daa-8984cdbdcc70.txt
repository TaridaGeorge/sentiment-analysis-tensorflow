I've tried to stay from reviewing America West because I worked here as a flight attendant. It's been years, though, and I'm still telling horror tales of my time here. I started here as a young, fresh-eyed girl that couldn't wait to travel and see new places. I left jaded and bitter more scared of flying than I had ever been before. I made lots of good friends and met lots of amazing people but everyone seemed unhappy with their job, pay, benefits, etc. 
I'll summarize by telling you this. . . . We had a joke contest  going around coming up with new company slogans. Mine won. It was "America West. Where departure times are just a suggestion".
