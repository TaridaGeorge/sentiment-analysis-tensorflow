Just got back from lunch with a friend.  I ordered the half portion of the ravioli and salad and she had whole wheat pasta spaghetti.  My ravioli was "hard"--neither of us finished our main course and we did not ask to take it home.  We both said almost together, we drove all the way here (from north scottsdale) to eat this??!!  Found the servers not very friendly.  Maggianos is much better and much closer.  Will not be going back to Marcella's.
