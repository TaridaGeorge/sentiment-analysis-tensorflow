Its apparent to me that US Airways has given-up being a normal USA airlline (a damn low standard!).  

I recently flew first class on four long legs (4-5 hours each): Boston -to-PHX-to-Kawaii and return.  Staff was nice enough, but cabin, seats, food, beverages, etc all substandard.
  
As if to illustrate how poor US Airways is now; upon my return home from Kawaii, I had to jump a short. 2-hour AA flight to Chicago.  Also in First Class.  The flight attendant greeted me at my seat by name (US Airways doesn't because a personal greeting costs...nada).  My drinks came in glass, not US AIr's fine First Class plastic.
