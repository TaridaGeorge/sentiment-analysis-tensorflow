Terrible CS, will never go back! Beware of terrible service. Bad attitude. Would not honor REI's return policy.  I will take my business to a store that treats me right. They make you think you are part of the CO-OP by buying in, what a joke.  I have been a member for over a decade and they have lost a loyal customer.
