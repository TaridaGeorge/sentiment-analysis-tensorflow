The only reason I tried China China is because of good yelp reviews.  I had the. Sweet and sour combo and I found it to be of low quality.  I am a Foodie and this was your typical fried pork covers with flavored daises. It did not taste like it was made in house but that it came out of a bag. For really good Chinese food. You may want to try China Chili.
