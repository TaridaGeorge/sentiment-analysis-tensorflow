I took my car in for a $50 oil change. Combs Auto Repair inspected it and told me I needed $2,312.61 in repairs; including rear brakes, air filter, head light service, transmission flush, battery, and engine mounts. I guess they did not realize I had just purchased my battery within a year and had replaced two of the engine mounts they said needed repairs. 

I took my car to another well known and respected repair shop and paid for an inspection. They said it did not need any of the above items Combs Auto Repair said I needed. 

It is unfortunate that Combs Auto Repair can't be trusted. I still need a good repair shop in North Scottsdale.
