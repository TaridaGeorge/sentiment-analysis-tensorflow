I took my friend here tonight as a "thank you" for letting me stay with her for four days.  I thought with 57 reviews and a 4 star rating I couldn't go wrong.  I was wrong.  Every "roll" was a giant pre-made california roll topped with something else.  The Spicy Tuna Roll had chopped up tuna on top and was not spicy.  My friend had to ask for a spicy sauce to go with it and the waitress explained that "our spicy tuna isn't spicy".  The last straw was the salmon roll which was, again, a california roll topped with baked chopped salmon.  It was inedible.  I couldn't understand why there were so many customers there.  I wouldn't eat here again if it were free.  I wish I had really listened to Mar A.'s review.
