Saw the Chelsea Handler show tonight.  First came her boy Josh, who told lots of masturbation jokes followed by Chelsea who told lots more.

Honestly, I was hoping for more complexity from a headliner.

OK Chelsea, we go that you hate kids, but honestly some of those little girls at the show, who can't walk in high heels are going to grow up and have babies and...not like you. 

Do you really have to show up bombed?  And get more bombed on stage?

Hell, even Kathy Griffin was better.
