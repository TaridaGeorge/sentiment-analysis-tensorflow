10 minutes... nobody acknowledges I'm here.  It's 1:45 and the restaurant isn't that busy, 2 servers, both of which pass me several times, and no greeting... no menu... no water... just flat out ignored.  Other patrons started to notice I was being ignored, even after hand gestures to get attention.

When the server's casual conversation started with the adjacent table I had to get up and just leave.  Unbelievable.
