I stayed here while I was searching for a house and I was kicked out because my payment was late one afternoon. I stayed here for about 1 month and I paid rent everyday on time. The manager also knew that my room was full of my personal belongings, so to be kicked out with no transportation setup to move me would be virtually impossible. As a result of that Half of my belongings were stolen. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone. Do not bring a lot of things with you and do not stay too long. And it is best to have a vehicle when you do stay. They also raised the rate without notification.
