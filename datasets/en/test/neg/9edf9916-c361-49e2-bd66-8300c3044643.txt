BIG MISTAKE.

It's really simple. I specifically asked the lady to just clean up around my sideburns, ears, and the back of my neck. I said "I do not want a haircut. Just clean up around the edges.

She did the exact opposite. She cut everywhere! I have super uneven side sideburns...in fact, the haircut itself is totally uneven from side to side.

Also, 2 of the 3 ladies working there barely spoke english. NEVER GOING BACK.

WORST haircut experience I've even had.
