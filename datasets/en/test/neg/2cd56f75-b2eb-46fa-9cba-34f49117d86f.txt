Ok, the Pete's by my office on Central just north of Broadway is great so when I decided to pick up a couple of shrimp and chips orders for my family on the way home today, I was sadly disappointed. The fries were a cold, soggy mess and the shrimp had about three tablespoons of table salt on it! You literally couldn't even see the breading it was all white and piled high with a thick layer of salt. GROSS!!
