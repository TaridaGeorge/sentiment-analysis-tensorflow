Went into this place the other day!! OMG what a frickin joke. They had some weird circus sex thing goin on...some boney freaky drugged out dancers in circus gear.  BARF. There was about two people in there. The DJS ALWAYS suck, this clearly should be flattened out into an empty warehouse, loose the bling or whatever you were "trying" to do, get a badass techno DJ like Donald Glaude or Tiesto, put in a booming sound system, cheap drinks and amazing lighting and START OVER. The door guys were dicks to people for so long it finally caught up with them. DONT CHARGE A COVER, YOUR CLUB LOST IT ALONG TIME AGO, TIME TO RE-BUILD. Take notes from Cream.
