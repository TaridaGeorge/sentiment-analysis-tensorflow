My apologies to FUDDRUCKERS! My wife and I were headed there when we saw this place and decided to try it. Here is what we think--worst food ever. STEAKburger is wafer thin and dripping with icky stuff onto our napkin. French fries were bad and I stuck one into the straw I had--it fit with no problem. We wonder how long it will be before this loser goes broke.
FUDDRUCKERS, WE WILL SEE YOU SOON!
