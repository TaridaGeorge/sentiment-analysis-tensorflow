The pharmacy is just terrible. You are ignored and abused. I just spoke to the manager.  She asked to phone if I had a good experience as she was going to speak to her manager. I told her that in three years I have not had a good experience. They Are harried, abrupt and semi rude. No eye contact no thank  you for coming. You are abused and demeaned ineveryway. Terrible , terrible terrible!  Walgreens is much better. They may be over worked but they are polite. 

If you want to give them you business go ahead, they have not earned it   
I will never go to that pharmacy again.
