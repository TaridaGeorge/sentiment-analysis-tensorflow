Probably the worst service I have ever had.  The bacon popcorn was good, but that was about it.  Took forever to get drinks, the orders were screwed up and the staff just came up with excuses why they could not bring out drinks within 20 minutes of ordering.  There are lots of choices in Old Town, don't go here.
