Go figure that this place would close. I've been to the original one and that one was a million times better than the one here in Dallas. The fries were mushy and gross, the burger didn't taste half as good, and the entire place was simply dirty looking. I couldn't even finish my burger and fries when I was there. I kept thinking over and over on how much the original one was so much fun from the moment I entered, to walking up the fry station, to leaving stuffed.

Oh well... I guess everything is worth the try.
