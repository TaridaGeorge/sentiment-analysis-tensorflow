I've been always loyal to AMC Theatres. The movie I was planning to see was sold out at Westgate, so I decided to drive 2 miles down the street to the Park West. When I went to buy the ticket's, the salesperson didn't even look at me. When I went to buy a pretzel at the consession stand, i said thank you and the worker just gave this stingy look. The only good thing about the theatre is that seat's are comfortable.
