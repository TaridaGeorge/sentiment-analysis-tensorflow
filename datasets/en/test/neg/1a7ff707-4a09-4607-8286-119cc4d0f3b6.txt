Mediocre at best.  After being told we would have a 20-25 minute wait, we waited over 45 minutes.  Ok, we could manage that even though we were starving.  We sat down and it was 15 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, then didn't come back with the drinks for another 15  minutes.  Getting our food was another 45 minutes.  What should have been no more than 2 hours ended up being over 3 hrs.  While the concept is great, and the food was good, it certainly isn't worth the prices.  My bill for 4 burgers, 3 drinks and an order of fries was $65, not including a tip.  If I wouldn't have used my $30 groupon I would have been extremely upset.  I could manage the prices if the service wasn't so horrendous.  I won't be back.
