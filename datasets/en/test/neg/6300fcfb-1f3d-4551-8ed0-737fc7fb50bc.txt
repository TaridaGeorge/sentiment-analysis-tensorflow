My friend and I went to see about the groupon I asked the cashier if I could buy 2, he asked to see my phone i handed it over thinking he was just reading the fine print and he hit buy and confirm. I later called to speak to a manager about this unauthorized charge and was told to call some other time the Metro Center location was not  anymore help. I'am astounded the clerk had the audacity to spend my money without my consent.
