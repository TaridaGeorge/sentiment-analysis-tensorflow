When you are new to Phoenix  metro area, you think people are car worshipers. When you take the bus more than 3 times for longer distances where you have to actually change line....you understand why in this ridiculously HUGE city you need a car. 

For a car ride of 15 minutes, calculate 1 hour or more. If you are lucky, no bus will run late, and if you are more lucky the bus will actually stop at its stop. 

Bring a book, and LOTS OF PATIENCE!!
