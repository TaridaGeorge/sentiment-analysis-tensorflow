I went to Octane when it first opened and have been there a few times since. I have basically watched this bar turn from a pretty cool local bar into a biker bar and now into a somewhat gangster rap bar.. music so loud that you need to see an ear doctor the next day.. hats tilted on heads, mens pants below thier asses with boxers showing. enough jewelry in human holes to create a strobe light, who can give the dirtiest look competitions.. just ridiculous..bring your numchucks because no one is here to have a good time unless your just as gangster as they are trying to be. But hey, if this is you.. this is your bar.

Ive never ever given a one star review, this is my first. 

 I do like the name of the bar though :)
