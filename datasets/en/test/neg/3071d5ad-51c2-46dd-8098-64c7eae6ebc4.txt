We looked at our entertainment book for pizza coupons and came across Domino's in some cruel twist of fate.  Since we hadn't had Domino's in easily 10 years and it was a pretty good coupon we decided in what later seemed a momentary lapse in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot.

It will likely be at least 10 years before we try them again.

Pizza that was on a par with those frozen ones from the grocery store and a free sandwich we shared that left us with tummy aches.

Despite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food.
