I just signed up for Yelp, and even though it's been awhile since I've been to this place, my experience was so bad, I had to write a review.  

The service at this place is horrible.  I don't expect someone to be over the top nice to me, but the lady was rude everytime I went in.  The last straw was when I checked out  a blouse and noticed that the buttons were ruined.  The lady didn't care and when I pushed she said I could call later and speak with the manager.  Seriously didn't care and clearly didn't want to do anything about my damaged blouse.  This was it, I was never going back.
