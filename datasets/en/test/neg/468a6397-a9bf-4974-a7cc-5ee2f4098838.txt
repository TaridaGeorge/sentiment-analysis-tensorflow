Avoid this Burger King at all costs! I used to frequent this place often, but over the past two years it's become awful. I highly recommend going hungry should that be the only other option. The cheese is always dry, the chicken is always soggy, and the fries are freshly cold anytime of day. I've even had terrible breakfast sandwiches here, which should be a crime. It's not difficult to make a fast food experiences worse but the employees take the cake in that category.  Avoid if you value your stomach and have to have Burger King, try the one at Broadway and Priest, the quality is worth the trip.
