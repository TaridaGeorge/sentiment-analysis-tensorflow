This company has no employee manual or handbook outlining employee policy with regards to employee conduct. The community in which I live is a gated condominium development. It has a gossipy nature. That's to be expected in a place like this. What makes it really bad is that the employees involve themselves in the gossip, and ths really causes alot of desension among the residents. I've contacted the managment at city properties, and they don't seem to be very receptive. I'll have to try some other approach. I can't understand why the board members don't give them the boot? Must be taking kick-backs. Absolutely unprofessional, disgusting company!
