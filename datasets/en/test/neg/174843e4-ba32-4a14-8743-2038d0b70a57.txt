I was in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale visiting college friends with the New Boy and celebrating the New Year holiday.

On New Year day, we dragged ourselves out of bed around 2:00 or 3:00 and heading to Mill Ave because we were STARVING.

Ra seemed like a good choice, so we struck in and found ourselves sitting on the back patio--the music inside was just WAY too loud. Our waitress made sake-bomb-action happen, which was a blessed relief. That was the best part of the experience.

The sushi was *ok*, the service sucked, and the ambiance was weird. We waited for over 30 minutes for our bill...I was about to walk out without paying just because I was tired of the place.

The overly-loud music varied between classic rock and dance music...they should have just left it on the dance music and left Cheap Trick and Foreigner at home.
