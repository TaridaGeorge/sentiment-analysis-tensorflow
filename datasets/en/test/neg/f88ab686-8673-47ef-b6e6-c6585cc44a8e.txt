After receiving hate mail for my previous review, I decided to edit this one and simply say that my opinion has not changed... this food is bad.

And I still think they could use the recipe to a Chicago dog, so I'm leaving that in, too! 

NO SUBSTITUTIONS ARE ALLOWED:

Vienna Beef dog- steamed, not charbroiled
Poppyseed bun
Yellow Mustard
Diced Onion- White (not yellow!!)
Green-dyed sweet pickle relish
Sport Peppers
2 tomato wedges
a Kosher dill pickle spear- crisp and fresh- Claussen is the best
Celery salt



If you want a REAL Chicago dog, try Niro's Gyros in Tempe.
