Horrible customer service! We waited for over an hour and a half only to be yelled at by the manager. And for a place with only decent sushi at best, they should really be focusing more on their service. Clearly they are not as "popular" as the manager says they are. I will not be going back. Walk across the street to stingray or drive over to ra or pearl. Trust me the service and food are far superior!
