I'm full and disappointed. I ordered shrimp egg foo young and crispy orange tofu. The egg foo young was burnt and even the sauce didn't saturate all of the burnt crispy edges. It was burnt, not over cooked but burnt enough to have that distinct burnt flavor. Fried shrimp were served on top, the condensation from the styrofoam container render the batter into a soft mush. I expected the shrimp to be mixed into the egg foo young cakes. The orange tofu on first bite was promising, but the the sweet sauce was just that sweet. It was not hot or spicy as the menu indicated. Considering the reviews I read prior to ordering I was really looking forward to this meal. Perhaps my experience is a fluke, still I'm not willing to spend my hard earned pennies on a second chance.  There's wasn't anything promising about the meal.
