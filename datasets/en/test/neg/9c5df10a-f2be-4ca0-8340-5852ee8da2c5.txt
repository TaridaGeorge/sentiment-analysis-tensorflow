Loud, obnoxious music.  Obscene wait to get in.  An even more obscene wait to get a drink.  Ridiculous patrons.  The feeling of either being a sardine or herded cattle, take your pick.  

I can say that I will not choose to come here again.  I will have to be dragged kicking and screaming like a 4 year old child who didn't get the toy they wanted whilst patronizing my Target store.  Skip it.

Oh.  The one star is for the drunk skanky women that end up dancing on the bar.  I am nothing if not a weak man.
