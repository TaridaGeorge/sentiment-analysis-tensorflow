I am currently staying at the Royal Palms.  The hotel is wonderful.  Beautiful setting.  I love the Spanish villa type architecture, however T Cook is shockingly awful.  I have hoped for wonderful meals at this nice restaurant but everything I've tried has been a tremendous disappointment.  Anyone who thinks they are going to get decadent food at this extremely expensive hotel will be hugely disappointed.  F-.  Outrageously disappointing.  WTF.
