YUCK! Why does everyone rave about this place? The pizza crust is TOO thin - it was SOGGY!  And they cut a ROUND pizza in SQUARES!!! WTF??? So I wound up with little weird-shaped outer pieces, and two large SQUARE center slices that were SO soggy that they just hung down when I tried to pick them up. Soggy and greasy. 

The cheese and mushrooms were good, but the sauce was indeed WAY too sweet as others have noted, and the so-called 'crust' was nasty and mushy. This is NOT Chicago pizza! I've had pizza in Chicago, deep dish AND regular, and this was NOT like any of it.
