This location from a service from the sales associate standpoint is great. 

Now, when you come in looking for something, they rarely have it.  This is definitely not like the location in Beverly Hills.  They do not stock many items at all and I find that to be a major disappointment for such a high end store.  Their corporate needs to look into their allocations and figure out how to keep their stores stocked appropriately.

Now, since they did not carry any of the 5 product I wanted I should mention that the associate was extremely helpful and offered to order the products in so that I could see them.  But, on a negative you have to wait 5 days for it to come in, not quite what you would expect from a boutique store.

Maybe I will give them another shot in the future.
