Don't get me wrong I actually enjoy the Subway franchise, but recently I went here for a sub and a few hours after I ate and had gone to bed, I woke up and started violently vomiting. Turns out I got food poisoning. Now let me tell you why I think it was Subway, I hadn't had anything else besides a bagel earlier that day for breakfast and I ate there at 2am, which is another thing the food had probably been sitting out for a few hours and silly me HAD to get double meat. I find it kind of humorous that Subway's slogan is "Eat Fresh", and this particular Subway obviously doesn't represent that slogan in a very positive light.
