I would never take my child to Sweet Tooth Pediatrics again.
If you do.....  Expect to be there two hours and half. Towards the End I had to walk out before financing was discussed for the following appointment. The dentist we saw said my daughter had 8 cavities. I went to get a second opinion and they only saw 3 small cavities. When I saw the xrays from Sweet Tooth I'm surprised they were able to see what they needed to see............ the film was so blurry. Protect your child get a second opinion. I called 3 times just to speak with some about my concerns. It took them about two weeks to get back to me. And still my concerns were never addressed.
