Definitely an odd spot.  I used to come here all the time before they started serving food.  The owner doesn't seem to know how to solve seating arrangements.  This is the first time ever when in a "seat yourself" cafe they would not let a single person sit a table.  Even though there were many tables available.  The owner was concerned that some potential large party could show up later on so she wanted to keep the empty tables empty.  Clearly not a very customer friendly approach.  And kinda silly.  Gelato is great here.  Skip the food.
