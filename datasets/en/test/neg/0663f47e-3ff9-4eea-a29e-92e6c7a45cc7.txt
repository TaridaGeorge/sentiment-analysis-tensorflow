I really wanted to like this place. 

At first I thought "Maybe I went on an off day". Nope, I tried shopping here for a week. It just feels... cheap. Like I am shopping at a crappy 97 cent store. Small selection of products. I personally can't trust the produce from here. Most of it isn't refrigerated, there were flies all over the place. On a high note, the meat here is beautiful. Which confuses me with the produce being sub-par. 

Oh, sad face emoticon.
