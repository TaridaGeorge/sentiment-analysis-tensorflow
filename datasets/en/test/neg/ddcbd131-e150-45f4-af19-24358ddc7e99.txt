As much as they claim to try hard at this place, management hasn't got a clue how to run a restaurant.  After countless attempts in good faith of trying to get a meal properly prepared from this establishment, they continue to mess up the orders and laugh it off.  The atmosphere is OK but servers must intentionally mess up orders for people they would prefer eat elsewhere.  We gave them plenty of tries to get it right but they still couldn't do it.  Go somewhere else.  Make food at home.  You will have a better experience than at this restaurant.  Maybe some day they will figure it out and actually serve the right food to their customers.  Until then... try the AM-PM Mini-market around the corner for a mini pizza.  Your service will be better and you get what you want.
