Went today. Not very busy and still took about 15 mins to get 2 burgers and a shake. The reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing TRAINING so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles, lettuce etc, all the garnishments. That alone took a good 5 mins. Meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold. Also the fries.

Then they called us up, I alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with 2 employees hovering over it.

Burgers were cold, fries were cold. Had to send it all back. UNREAL!!!!

I have been to Joes at LEAST 20x since its in our neighborhood and our last 5 experiences have been HORRIBLE.

So disappointing. This place used to be great!
