If not for the service I would have not given this place 1 star.  Just BAD.  Overpriced, with no creativity. If you are impressed by a hugh boiled lobster, raw veggies and uncle bens box rice then this is for you.  I think next time I will jump a Southwest flight to Boston, have my lobster and fly home and still have money for drinks.
