Leave it to me to go to a red meat based restaurant and order the lunch fish and chips! BIG mistake! LOL!!!

Do Not order the fish and chips!

I sat on the outside verandah and although the seating was nice, the mall music was too annoying with the restaurant background noise.

It seems like most of these places I am finding in the East valley are geared toward a high Alcohol sales platform with very large bars and seating in those areas.

I may try a burger or steak perhaps in the future.
