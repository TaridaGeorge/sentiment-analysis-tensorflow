literally, the worst pedicure and customer service I have experienced. The man who preformed my pedicure was pleasant pleasant enough but when i asked if he could do a nail design did not understand me. 

I was excited to have a hot stone massage (which is included) in all of the pedicures. My service provider did not apply any pressure and gave me and a not so relaxing massage. also, isn't a pedicure about your feet?! He did not touch the bottoms of my feet with lotion, no nice massaging, no pressure points hit, no massaging of my calves. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, not worth $20 any day.
