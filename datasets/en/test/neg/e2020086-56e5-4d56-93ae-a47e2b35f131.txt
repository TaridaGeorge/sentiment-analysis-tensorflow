Went mid afternoon order a pulled pork sandwich, rack of ribs... wouldn't consider this place authentic by any means... I've had better frozen meals in my time. Also so called "handmade" root beer wasn't as good as I expected. Pulled pork sandwich bun was stale, and actual meat on sandwich was dry. Not worth the 20 or so bucks I wasted.
