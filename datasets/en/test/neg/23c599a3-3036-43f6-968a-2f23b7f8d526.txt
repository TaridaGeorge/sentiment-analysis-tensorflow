Is it possible to give a zero star rating because this place certainly is worthy of one.  The family and I were going to the Dodger vs D-Backs game on 9/25 and after wandering aimlessly around the stadium we made the mistake of choosing this place.  After being seated in the outdoor area we waited for almost 15 minutes before our waitress took our drink order.  It only got worse from there.  The wife ordered the southwest sliders which were dry, flavorless and came with just one small slice of jalapeno.  I had the pulled pork sliders which were also dry with the worst bbq sauce I have ever had.  Poor service and even worse food guarantees there will be no return visit.
