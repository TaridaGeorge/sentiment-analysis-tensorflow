I went into get a copy of my test and was informed that it would take 7-10 days to get a copy of a test that I DID 7 months ago? Huh? Everthing was fine according to them/result and I offered to wait, until Dr. Mikel was free to review my notes and release them. I was then, told that he might not even get to my chart today.... Geez . Needless to say, I won't be back. But if you have plenty of time to waste, definitely go there.
