Im not a sushi person so maybe my review wont be useful. I went cuz the hubby wanted sushi. I figured a veggie roll and some teriyaki beef would be cool. The veggie roll wasnt bad, but it was actually just avocado. My teriyaki beef was terrible! It tasted and looked like it was boiled then spray painted grill marks. It was cold, chewy and hard to swallow. Very dissapointing!! I asked the hubby  how he felt about the sushi he ordered and he said it was ok, not 4 stars thats for sure. Im sure they are great, but not interested in a second visit.
