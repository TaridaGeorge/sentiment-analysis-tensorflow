I like dive bars as much as the next guy, but this place made me feel rather dirty just for being in there.  I sat with my girlfriend at the outdoor patio, and a large crowd circled around a few tables decided to have an ice cube fight.  The servers came and went while this was going on, but didn't seem to care and didn't do anything about it, even though the ice was hitting innocent bystanders (such as me and my girlfriend).    The various pre-made frozen drinks seem like a fun concept, but this place really does strike me as a true armpit.  Avoid.
