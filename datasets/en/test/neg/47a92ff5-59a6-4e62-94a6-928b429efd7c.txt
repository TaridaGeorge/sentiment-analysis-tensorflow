how can I get my iPod fixed?  these little snots won't wait on me.  I have to go online to make an appointment, even though I went to the store. They only take appointments for two days ahead, but you have to go on line to do it--- WTF?  You have to make it online? 
And why are they dressed like little Steven Jobs clones?
