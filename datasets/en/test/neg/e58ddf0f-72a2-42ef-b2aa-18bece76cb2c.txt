Worst Chinese place in town . Food was cold, would not even meet health dept codes for temp requirements for the safety of the general public. Needs to be reported and shut down. I'm hoping I don't get sick from the sample size bites of all the food I tried, hoping to find something to eat. I'm talking Costco / Sams Club size samples. When I refused to pay, the manager lady yelled at me for being angry. She doesn't know angry. 

Plus their children were working. What about child labor laws? 

The only reason I gave 1 star is because there is not an option for zero or negative digits.
