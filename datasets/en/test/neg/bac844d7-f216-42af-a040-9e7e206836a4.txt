Ok never going back to this place again. Easter day nothing open, heard about this place figured it would ok. The host that walked us to the table and left without a word. Maybe an "enjoy" would have been nice. He then tells a server "I sat you" Server looks at our two top and grunts. Nice. I'm already so happy to be here. It just gets worse. The food tasted awful. Our server sneezed into his hands twice and kept working. We asked for side plates and he asked another server if there was another and she said this is the only one here and I don't know if it's clean. Talked to the manager after and he said sorry thanks for letting me know, but he never even asked where I was sitting. Never again.
