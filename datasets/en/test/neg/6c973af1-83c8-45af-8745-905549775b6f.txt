Been a patron for years. Eat- In and Carry-Out, never a tab below $50. Disappointed again last night for the last time. Food was inedible, we joked that we should feed it to our dog, but we really love our dog, threw it away. Shrimp Emperial, $18.95, Shrimp was clearly frozen too long and tainted the whole watery, bland dish with bad fish smell. Baked Ziti, $10.95, watery, bland, have had better from a can. Biggest disappointment... Antipasto Misto, $10.95 for Oscar Meyer and Rubbery Caprese. Really sad because it used to be a great neighborhood restaurant, now its perfect if you're from out of town, don't like good Italian, and will never be back.
