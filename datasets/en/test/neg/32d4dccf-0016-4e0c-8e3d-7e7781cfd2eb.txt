I have only been to this location once, but will definitely never return.  I showed up with my girlfriend, a member (not for long), and we had to wait for 10 to 15 minutes to even be greeted because there were too many people in the lobby.  This meant we were shorted some time from our massages.  Apparently this has continued for quite some time for my lady - now that she is trying to cancel her membership, they are making it so difficult its absolutely offensive.  Terrible customer service and terrible business practice.
