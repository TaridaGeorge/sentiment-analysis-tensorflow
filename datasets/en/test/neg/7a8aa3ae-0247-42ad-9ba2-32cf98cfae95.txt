Don't go!!!  Tony's WAS the best shoe repair.  There are NEW owners who can not be trusted.  You have to pay in advance and their prices have really gone WAY UP!  They give you a little 'pink card' with your number as a receipt.  If you don't have your little pink card - good luck!!  They have no way of finding your shoes.  Their work is POOR, they are rude and their prices are crazy.  The good reviews for Tony's are old - NOT for these new owners.
