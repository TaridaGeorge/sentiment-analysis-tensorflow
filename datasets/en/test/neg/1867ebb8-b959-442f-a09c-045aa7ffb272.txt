I arrived 6 minutes after they opened on a Saturday morning, and left exactly one minute later. They only had two technicians working (each already with someone), and we're explaining to the lady in front of me it would be 30 minutes and they were going to call someone in. Then they looked at me and said "can you come back at noon?" um....No. If I wanted my nails done at noon, then I would have come at noon. Needless to say, I will not go back. Nails Too got me in and out with a fabulous nail job!
