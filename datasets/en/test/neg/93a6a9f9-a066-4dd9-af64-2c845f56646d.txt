Well, I got this chocolate as a present for Valentines. When I met the "chocolatier" I was with an African American friend.  She completely ignored my friend.  She didn't know that my friend purchased her chocolate as a gift for me through a Living Social deal.  I love chocolate.  I have purchased gourmet truffles including raw chocolate from chocolatiers in different parts of the country.  Some of my favorites have been in Portland, OR, Orange County, Ca, and San Francisco, CA.  Her chocolate was my least favorite.  Almost every truffle has been out of balance with unusual aftertastes.  I am simply not a fan.  I doubt that either of us will every buy this product again.
