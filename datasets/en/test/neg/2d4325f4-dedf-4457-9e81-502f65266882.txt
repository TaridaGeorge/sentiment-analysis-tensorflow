So a coffee fiend (me) walks into Zoom Espresso. He asks for a hot cafe americano (which is on the menu, by the way).

The young dude behind the cash register gives him a blank stare and asks "What's in a cafe americano?"

"Two shots of espresso and water," says the coffee fiend.

"Nobody's ever ordered one of those here before."

"Umm, just gimme a large cup of regular coffee."

And even that wasn't good. If a place has the word "espresso" in the name, it's necessary to have someone who can pull at least a competent shot of espresso. And knows what an americano is.
