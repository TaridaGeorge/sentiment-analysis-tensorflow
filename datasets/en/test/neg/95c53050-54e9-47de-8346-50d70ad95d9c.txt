DO NOT go to this restaurant if you are looking for a relaxing evening with good food.  This place is a fast food, chaotic joke!  The prices are high for the quality of food that is served and it is apparant that the food is "pre cooked" and simply picked up in the kitchen and served immediately upon ordering.  New Years Eve dinner took about 34 minutes from beginning to end, and that included appitizers and wine!!   Quite honestly comparing this place to Houstons is an insult to Houstons!  There is no comparison!  I wont be returning!
