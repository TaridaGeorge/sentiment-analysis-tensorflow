STAY AWAY.  ABSOLUTE CROOKS!  They were referred by AHS Home Warranty company (that's a whole other can of worms) to fix our water heater.  Long story short, their technician said we needed to replace water heater and then claimed that they would need an additional $350 out of my pocket due to "modifications" needed to electrical and water lines.  I was not there when technician came out.  Turns out all connections to water heater are flexible (gooseneck) which does not require any modification at all.  C N J services was simply trying to RIP OFF $350 from me because I was not there when they came out (my tenant met them).

Stay far away from these crooks.  I will also be filing COMPLAINTS with the BBB and the AZ REGISTRAR OF CONTRACTORS against this very shady company.
