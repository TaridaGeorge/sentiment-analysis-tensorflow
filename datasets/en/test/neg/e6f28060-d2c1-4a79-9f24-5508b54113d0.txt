My first mistake was letting my friends convince me to go to this place on St. Patty's Day.  Big mistake.  Apparently, they have some big St. Patty's Day party where they block off part of the street in front of the place and charge $10 to get in.  I think that gets you some free grub, which I saw plenty of people eating, but which I was too tepid to try.  Also, they don't accept ANY credit cards that night -- cash only -- so make sure you stop at the bank before you come.
