Save your money and time.  It took over an hour just to get our lunch served and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant, even after expressing to our waiter that we were in a rush.

Ordered off the basic Taste of the Island menu.  The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.  Not impressed especially for a restaurant near the ASU downtown campus.  Lots of other places that serve good quality food at a reasonable time.
