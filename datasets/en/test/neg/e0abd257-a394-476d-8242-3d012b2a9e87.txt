I don't think I will ever come back to this theater.  Despite it being a fine facility with adequate seats, bathrooms, etc.  We went here to see Insidious and there was a huge group of teeny boppers here that wouldn't shut up.  I went out and told the manager finally and they came in and tried to silence them (unsuccessfully).  Hey mangaers, next time kick them out!  The people who paid good money deserve to see the movie they paid for in silence.  I won't be coming back here ever.
