Seriously?  Who likes this chain bs quality crap?

I like myself a badass sandwich.  This place DOES NOT have it.

Inadequate portions, inadequate food, un-personable service and tacky typical "bread/bakery co" atmosphere.  I've now been over 5 times since i moved here 4 months ago, and not one visit has been satisfactory or fulfilling.  I'm going to wildflower with better portions and flavor or taking a trip to pane bianco.  

Dont waste your taste buds.
