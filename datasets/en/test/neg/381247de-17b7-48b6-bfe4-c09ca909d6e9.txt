We scheduled an appointment with this company a week in advance. They promised they would call the evening before the appointment to confirm or no later than 8 a.m. the morning of the appointment. They never called. We called them about 8:30 a.m. on appointment day and were told they would call us between noon and 2 p.m. to tell us what time they would arrive. They never called. So at 3:45 p.m. we called AGAIN and were told their technician had been "down in a ditch" all day. So what? Does that mean they can't call their customers? Is this any way to run a business? Their YELP writeup says they treat customers the way they want to be treated. Well now. That's really sad.
