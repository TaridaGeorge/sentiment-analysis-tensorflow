DO NOT FLY US AIRWAYS. You will regret it if you do. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My son was stranded in the Arizona airport because his first flight was late coming from Palm Springs and he missed is connection flight to Seattle.
The airlines booked him on a flight the next afternoon, but gave him know
hotel or meal vouchers. What is a mother to do. I called the airport, the airlines, no one could do anything. RATED 0
