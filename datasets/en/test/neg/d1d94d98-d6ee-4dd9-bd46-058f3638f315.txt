This place is pathetic and should be put down by Macy's. Mercy kill it and reopen it as a clearance center a la the neighboring Dillard's Clearance Center since this dog just won't hunt anymore.

The sales floor is spacious and easy to navigate because there is such a small and limited selection. Little sprigs of clothing in the major sections, one cut of jeans per denim line for example, sparse to the point where there is no point. 

Major flagship brands that you can count on Macy's to carry? 

Not at Mesa Fiesta anymore. 

The lack of selection overall means sales selection is pathetic, just absolutely sad and not worth the time.
