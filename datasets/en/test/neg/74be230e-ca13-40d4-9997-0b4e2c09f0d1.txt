After viewing the mostly positive information presented on this site, we thought we would check out this restaurant for a taste of Cuba.  Sadly, we were greatly disappointed in almost every aspect of our dining experience.

The waitress pretty much ignored us when we arrived, and seemed indifferent to us over most of our meal.  They no longer have a buffet, and we were also not able to order the Cuban Sandwich on the day we went (though the waitress never explained why).

Although the food we ordered was tasty, the meat dishes were a bit tough.  I'd rate the food itself no higher than 3 stars over all in quality, and the price was very steep for what we received.

Poor service, high prices, and mediocre food...it was very disappointing, and we won't be back again.
