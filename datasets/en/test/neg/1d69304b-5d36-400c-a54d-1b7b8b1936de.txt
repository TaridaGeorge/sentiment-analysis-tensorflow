This place is no longer!!!!!!!  Hurray!!!! I knew they would'nt be around for long. The worst managed sportsbar ever. The new owners, and management have really turned this place around. The food is noticably better. The service is good now, and finally they have started to remodel, plus new LCD flat panel TV's. This place used to be Dutch John's back in the eighties, and had really never updated anything until now. It's now called the Tavern Grill. Check it out!
