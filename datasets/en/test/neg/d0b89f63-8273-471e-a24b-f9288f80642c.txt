We had high hopes for Zpizza.  I loved their selection of pizza combos, crusts, and toppings - and then I tried the pizza....

Bland, cheap with toppings, metallic sauce - no wonder they offer so many combinations, they're hoping you find one that doesn't suck.  Droopy, soggy crust too - maybe they should worry less about their website and more about their food.  

The kicker tonight was to find out that they don't deliver their mediocre pizza outside of three miles.  This means they don't deliver to most of DC Ranch and none of McDowell Mountain Ranch or Windgate Ranch - genius.
