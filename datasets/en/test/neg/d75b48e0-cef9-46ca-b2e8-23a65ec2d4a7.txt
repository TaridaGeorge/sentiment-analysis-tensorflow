So, I thought I could pick up some things for school since the campus bookstore was closed. "Just a few notebooks, they're cheap," I says to myself. 

But uh, here at CVS, I actually laughed aloud at what they were selling this stuff for. Paper was five dollars and UP. 

First you kill Sahara, now you want TEN DOLLARS for a spiral-bound notebook?!

Die.
