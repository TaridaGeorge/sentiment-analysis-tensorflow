This place needs about negative 20 stars. I lived in California before they moved out here. Coming back to Arizona I thought I was safe from the insanity these locations caused. I swear I'm in a Fringe (or X-files, for the older Yelpers) episode. I had a co-worker who made a trip to LA and said one of the reasons was to get a burger from here. I asked him to stop taking the drugs. Plain and simple: the tasteless patties on every burger have the consistency of sun-dried cow patties and sadly they may be the best thing on the menu. Oh and I have a burger like, once a year, since my sister insists that I give it a try since she loves it. Don't worry I make sure she takes her pills.
