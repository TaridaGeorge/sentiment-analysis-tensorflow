Not Impressed.... 
The staff was really nice... The lobby smelled and looked amazing... We stayed in the main building, maybe because it was the oldest part of resort, but I was not impressed. Towels run down.....
nothing special in the rooms...... not impressed at all....
This was a business trip as my husband works for the Federal Government and were here on Government rate.... I think it is quite sad if the Biltmore puts Government Employees in the not so nice parts of the hotel because of their Government Rate Fare.... Not impressed... Embassy Suites next time... they have much more to offer for those who serve this country.....
