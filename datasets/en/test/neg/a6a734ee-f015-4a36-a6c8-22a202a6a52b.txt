I used to love shopping at Sunflower!!  The produce was great.. with a nice selection of organic and organic binds... the prices were good..cashiers were nice!!!  WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS STORE!!!  First the produce was old..lettuce was old and soggy in the container, the onion I bought yesterday sprouted!! The kale was obviously old and yellow!!  I started returning things..something is wrong at this store..Then I was in over the weekend..t only got a few things..and went to the bind with organic Apricots..the bind was half full..I took some out..AND THEN I NOTICED INSECTS, FLYING AROUND INSIDE THE BIND!!!  Thats it, I'm done..and will take my business elsewhere..
