This is hands down the worst Pizza I have ever had. I had to go to Nello's after hearing my boss rave about it. I went on a Saturday night; the place was about 20% full. I ordered a sausage, onion and greenpepper thin crust. My first clue that this experience was taking a turn for the worse was when the pizza arrived with the toppings on top of the cheese. Maybe that's why there was no taste. Not even the seasoned pepper's flakes could bring this pie to life. The sausage was nasty. In summary, Nello's was brutal.
