This was a very disappointing dining experience. Despite friendly staff, none of the three entrees we ate were properly cooked, especially the way overdone pork chop.

Service is friendly, but there are better restaurants within this hotel not to mention within walking distance of the hotel.  

My suggestion, skip it...
