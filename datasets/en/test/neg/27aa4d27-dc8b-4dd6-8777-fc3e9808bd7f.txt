They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.

I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.

To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.

I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine.
