I don't really want to get into it because I don't like saying a ton of negative things, but I really had an awful experience with this office.  A lot of my information was lost, my treatment was delayed, and I had a hard time actually talking to someone when I called.  However, there are obviously patients that really like this office and have had great experiences.  Over the course of a year, my experiences were just really not very good and I would not go back here.
