So, first off. If you are going to call it happy hour, don't just take 30 percent of the food off the plate and give me a 30 percent discount. that's horse shit.   
$3.50 coors light  on happy hour? FU, coors light should probably not be 3.50 ever. thats a rip.



Lindsay, Lauren??? I dont know, brown haired girl behind bar. You have to be a TON hotter/friendly to give this bad of service and get away with it. I thought it was weird that my beer was empty for so long, so I went to take a piss and noticed it wasnt a special treat for me, everyone had empty beers. 


While I was in the pisser I thought to myself, "self, this looks like a pisser in a frat house" 

SO, I left.
