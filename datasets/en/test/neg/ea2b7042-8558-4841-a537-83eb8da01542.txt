Dirtiest Tablecloths in Phoenix area: At first the atmosphere is appealing, once you manage to get inside the non-broken door (are they EVER going to fix it?). The tablecloths at this place are simply disgusting. Plenty of stains, from overusage in the past and also sometimes fresh ones from the previous diners. Employees often have food stains on their white shirts, which I can't understand either. Overall, very dirty place.

I managed to give the food a try anyway (don't ask why). Overall, very average for Indian Cuisine. The Naans were rather uninspiring, so stick to the paratha or poori. Vegetable Pakora is dry and chalky. Mint chutney is watery. To top it off, several of the menu items aren't available but they haven't changed the menu. They used to have a southern Indian chef who would make dosa. No more.
