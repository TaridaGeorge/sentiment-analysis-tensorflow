I don't get this place. The food completely lacks seasoning and flavor. Highly overpriced and they charge you $1 per drink to drink YOUR own drinks you bring! Then $7 per bottle for wine.

Skip this place. It does not deserve the high marks. 

The food comes out raw and then you cook it yourself in 2 different pots of boiling water. One dark, one light. Neither had any flavor.

Good luck trying to get any service either. Our water glasses sat empty pretty much the entire time we were there.
