US Airways knows nothing about customer service and refuses to correct, and admint they were wrong.  
Their flight attendant Bambi wet out of her wany to berate me in fromt of all the other passengers because I didn't have a pen on board.  
I wrote US Airways explaining that I am a passenger and the one thing I do not deserve is a horribly rude flight attendant.  US Airways refused to even apologise for the situation and kept sending response letters that had nothing to do with what I wanted.
I warn everyone that Bambi on US Airways flight 1966 from Charlotte to Punta Cana to stear clear of her, she will ruin you flight and vacation.  US Airways got my money and refuses to refund it.
