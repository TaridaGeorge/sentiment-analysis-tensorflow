WHAT. THE. HECK?! This place has gone to CRAP since new mngt.  EVERYTHING has gone down hill.  They fired all the long-standing bartenders & servers (the ones who knew what they were doing).  

The last time we went they served our food with PLASTIC forks, paper napkins and PLASTIC plates?!  (surprised our martinis didn't come in sippy cups?!?)  

Will NOT be back, ESP. since the FABBY new ANGEL's & OUTLAWS just opened around the corner - guess who opened it?  The management who kept Devil's running smoothly for 5 years !!  (and the bartenders joined them :-)
