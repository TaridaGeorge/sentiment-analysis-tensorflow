I think most would agree, the reason for eating at a chain restaurant is "consistency!"  Unfortunately, this location doesn't get it.  With them, "life IS like a box of chocolates..."  The food is edible to bad, the bartenders couldn't produce two identical Bloody Mary's if their lives depended on it, the waiters don't know whether to stand or crouch to take orders, your table is never cleared regardless how full of dishes, and worst of all - you are either "Dude or Hon!"  Stay home!  Don't go!  If you live in the area and need a late night bite, there's a Denny's about one-half mile west on Chandler Blvd.  Yes, I know Denny's isn't the best either - but breakfast for dinner is never bad!
