Don't park your car and expect it to be there when you come out after eating there.  They towed my car today because I did not eat in the restaurant.  Unfortuantly we did eat there and could not get out of the parking lot because of event across the street.  So we walked around the nuthouse01area for a bit came back and car was gone. Talked to manager who said we did not eat there and I showed receipt and was told that was I was not seen on some camera so I did not eat there.  Now have to wait until Monday to get my car.  Well thats it never eat here again.  

Lost customer for ever Wendy'  Wish Dave were alive he would have treated customer much differently.
Shame on Wendy's
