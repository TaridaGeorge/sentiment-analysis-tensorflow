Worst service in all of Phoenix. We waited an hour in front of our hot pot broth. They ran out of our ordered food, forgot to give us the dipping sauces and the serving spoons. When we told the waitress,  her response: "How was I suppose to know."  Better alternative: Top ramen at home!!!! We will NEVER got back!!
