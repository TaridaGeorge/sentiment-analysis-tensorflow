uh.... no. If I want to blaze up with the hookah this might be the joint (pardon the expression). If I want to shoot pool? No way in hell I will be back to this place. I use to work at a failing pool hall in Seattle and I see much of the same here... 1. No booze. Cool, but that always means over priced table time. 2. No A/C uh.... really, you think i will be back and invite my friends to sweat it out at 108 degs in your boring over priced  smokey pool hall?....your are smokin the hope-iam my friends. Times are tough, i get it, but the winners are not who offers less, but who offers more.... you, I am sad to say lose in an epic way.
