Ra Ra Sis Boom Blah.. Ive tried so many times to eat here and like it since there aren't  really any other sushi restaurants nearby.  Its just not happening. Sure they have a great happy hour prices, but I don't think I should have to fish lemon seeds out of my sake bottle, or have little nats swimming around in my soy sauce. The sushi wasn't very fresh at all. This would be a great place to go if you've never eaten sushi before, so then you'd have nothing to compare it to.
