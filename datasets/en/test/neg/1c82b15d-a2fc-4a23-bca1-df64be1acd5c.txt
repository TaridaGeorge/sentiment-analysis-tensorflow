this plays blows.. the food is decent but the portions are tiny..the main course was smaller than an appetizer at a normal place yet they charge the same if not more. if you choose to eat here, prepare to hit up some mcdonalds or jack in the box after.. or you can just go to deluxe next door and get their chicken panini!
