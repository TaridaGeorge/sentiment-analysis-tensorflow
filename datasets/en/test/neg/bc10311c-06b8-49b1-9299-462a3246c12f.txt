With family rolling in from Cali, my westside crew decided we should hit up a happy hour at Westgate.  We mosey into GB and scan the menu, which didn't appeal to me at the time.  I sipped some iced tea and ordered the calamari which turned out to be rubber bands with horrible marinara sauce.  Everyone else had spring rolls, sliders, and garlic fries.  
I wasn't in the mood for bar food - it happens. 
After attempting to chew bland squid I have a feeling I won't be in the mood to visit this establishment ever again.  I might hold off on ordering calamari for a bit as well... they pretty much ruined one of my favorite apps.  
Also, the one in Tempe has horrible service.
