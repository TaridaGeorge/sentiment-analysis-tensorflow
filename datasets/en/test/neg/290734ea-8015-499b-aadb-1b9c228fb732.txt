We are staying at the resort and my husband wanted a steak, so despite the bad reviews we thought we would give it a try. 

Steak was ok. Prices were very high, service was slow and snotty. Had the goat cheese salad. Not only was there very little goat cheese, there was very little salad. Asparagras came with the steak, he got 2 pieces. 

Should have paid attention to the reviews. 

Don't waste your money, unless you want to end us paying $60+  for a steak and not much else.
