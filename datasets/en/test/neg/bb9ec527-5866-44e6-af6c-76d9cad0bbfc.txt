The Gate Attendant was incredibly rude and disrespectful to us if front of other customers (and, this was after we volunteered to give up our window seat because she needed someone to sit in the exit isle.)  No perks, no thank you, simply a shrew of an employee having a bad day and then taking it out on a customer. 

Let's put it this way, she was so rude that all three (3) flight attendants who overheard her, apologized to me later during the flight.  One even offered to buy me a drink.  While I appreciate their efforts, I'm horrified that a US Airways Gate Attendant has no customer service training and is allowed to strut around like the monarch shouting "Off with their heads."  The incident gave us a very poor image of US Airways.

Next time we'll book with another airline.
