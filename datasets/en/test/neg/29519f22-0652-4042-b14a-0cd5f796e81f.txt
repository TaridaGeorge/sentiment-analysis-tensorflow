It's been two years since I stepped foot in this place, which as coincidence would have it, was both the first and the last time. 

IIRC, it's 18 and up but you can get a hand stamp or wrist band if you want to drink the Devil's sweet, sweet nectar.   

Lots of punk kids in here playing pool, I felt like a damn grandpa.  Might be cool if you really like pool, or want to prey upon fresh nubile 18yo pool hall skanks.
