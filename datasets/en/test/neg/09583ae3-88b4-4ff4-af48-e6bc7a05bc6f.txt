We ordered food from this restaurant for my son's birthday party. The owners forgot about the order day of the event- due to their neglect, we didn't get the food we ordered, my husband ended up missing 45 minutes of our son's party. The owner did not ask for payment when my husband got the food- so we thought reasonably the food was free to compensate for their mistakes. We do not hear from them for almost 6 weeks then they called our house day and night demanding payment. Oh yes, it gets worse- they ended up suing us in civil court over a bill that was less than $200!! It was a total nightmare experience. Don't have any dealings with this restaurant!!
