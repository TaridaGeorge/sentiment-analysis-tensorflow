Although I can not vouch for the food, the service was horrendous!  I was with a group that called ahead for reservations 3 weeks in advance (18 for a bachelorette party).  Upon arrival we were put in a tiny corner on one couch and 15 fold out chairs....huddled around two small teak patio furniture side tables.  When politely confronting the manager on his staffs lack of communication to our party about the accommodations he got MAJOR attitude.  Not what I would expect from a "professional" who apparently "owns 3 restaurants".  We took our business elsewhere FAST!  Would NOT recommend this place for dinner...snacks maybe...but BEWARE of DIVA manager!!!
