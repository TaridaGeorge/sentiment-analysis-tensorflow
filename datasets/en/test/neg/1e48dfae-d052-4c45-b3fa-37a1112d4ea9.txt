I don't know why I almost always end my trip reviews with a bad one on a fast food restaurant at the airport.  This is no different.

Seriously, I know life sucks when you work at a fast food restaurant at the airport.  If you don't want to work there, maybe you should find another job.  It's definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you don't feel like taking my order.

I did get an extra piece of nugget.  In your face.
