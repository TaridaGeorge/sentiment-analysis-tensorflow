The Coffee - standard starbucks.

The People that work here?  Zombies

I've been coming here for 6 months and order the exact same 'ordinary' thing, and NOT ONCE have that remembered what I order.  It's a friggin coffee - plain - same size every friggin time.

One visiting this location should not expect any "hospitality", "emotion", "intelligence", "warmth" or any normal service that one would get at a more personal cafe.

Get your coffee and leave - and remember, the coffee isn't THAT good anyway.

This place sucks.
