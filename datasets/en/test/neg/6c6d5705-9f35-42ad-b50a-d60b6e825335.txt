The music is pounding...

It reeks of ridiculously strong cologne masking young adult male insecurity...

Some guy younger than my kid brother is walking around without a shirt...

Everything is super overpriced for what you get...

In the grand tradition of overcompensation and brand whoring there is a name plastered all over everything...

No one is genuine either in their efforts to help or able to make real eye contact and stop texting...

Is it a bar in Belltown in the late 90s? Is it a frat party? Is it a spring break trip?

No, it's Pimpercrombie & Bitch! Now I remember why it had been at least ten years since the last time I walked in one of these cesspools of humanity and child labor sweatshops. Maybe next time I will wait 20 years...if they make it that long.
