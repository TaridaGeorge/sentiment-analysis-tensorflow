For $60.00 I could have feed five people at the Golden Coral & would have gotten better steaks. 
The waitress laughed at me when I used my cell phone to illuminate the plates. Seeing as the lighting was too dim to even see the plate. My date's steak has so much fat he had to re-carve the darn thing with each and every bite. He left more than half on the plate. The steak I ordered was old, not aged. I had sat in the cooler far too long. The edges were cooked well but the inside of the meat was gritty and worse than burnt meat. The tomato garnish was so bitter and sour it turned my stomach.
The iced tea was weak. The potatoes were edible compared to the steaks.
The music was good.
