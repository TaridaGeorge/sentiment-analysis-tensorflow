I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat.....
....at the worst Applebee's in America
....vending machine food
....my own flesh

Now, Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap? 

The rainforest "thunderstorm" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink, you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan.
