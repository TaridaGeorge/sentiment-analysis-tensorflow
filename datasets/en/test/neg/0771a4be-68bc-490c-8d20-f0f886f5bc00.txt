What can you say about a church that puts an old hateful woman (short white hair) in their admin. Office. If wasn't the only visitor who witnessed her very unchristian like behavior to a woman who came asking for help. One must assume this is not a good or decent church. I won't be back & will absolutely make sure people know about what happened. Do they actually read the bible at this church??? Your supposed to love your neighbor & give what you have to those who ask.
