Sorry everyone.  This was one of the WORST EXPERIENCES in dining I have ever had.

This is by far one of the most over rated places in the country. 

Food:  Pizza and Salad: Good.
Server:  Good.  Felt Sorry for the guy.  I didn't tip and told him that he should blame the hostess stand.
Wait:  2 hours.  Which is fine if the hostess stand would have been more accomodating for those waiting. 

Total Vibe from Hostess Stand:  POOR BEYOND DESCRIPTION.

I don't mind sitting around for 2 hours to be seated.  If the dining experience was out of this world.  

Felt the Hostess stand was highly inefficient with seating that's why it takes so long.  I felt they were rude an unaccomodating.

Recommend:  Never.  The Pizza is not that good to sit around for. 
Go Back:  NEVER.  NEVER   NEVER.
