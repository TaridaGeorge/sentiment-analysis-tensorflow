Beware!  My truck was stolen in the parking lot here!   

There are no cameras.  My wife and I met for lunch here and within 45 minutes my truck was gone.  

I spoke to the management and was told that this is a problem here and yet no cameras and no security.

I had my truck returned to me about 2 weeks later via the DPS.  It was found in the desert south of Maricopa.  It had been used to transport illegals or drugs.  

It was in such bad shape that I sold it for salvage value.
