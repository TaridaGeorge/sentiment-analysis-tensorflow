My fianc√© and I have been loyal Lux customers for sometime now. While out shooting some engagement footage for our upcoming wedding we decided to stop in get some coffee and maybe a clip or two of us in Lux since it has been one our fave date places in the past. Upon sitting down the owner abruptly came over to our table in a very rude fashion and informed us that this was His property. Very sarcastically asked our videographer if he was professional. And basically gave us the boot.  We would have totally been willing to put the camera away if he had been even slightly courteous. There coffee quality pails in comparison to cartel but in the past we thought it was a chill atmosphere. Needless to say we will no longer be fans of Lux. Viva Cartel!
