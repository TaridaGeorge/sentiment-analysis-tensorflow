HORRIBLE!!!!!! My husband and I wanted some good breakfast there were some mixed reviews on this place, so we decided to try it... I sat down and ordered the Strawberry Waffle and bacon, my husband ordered the chopped Steak and eggs... My SO-Called strawberry waffle came with NO strawberries and the bacon was thin as paper. I asked where my strawberries were to put on the top of my waffle and she said they were inside my waffle... MY WAFFLE LOOKED LIKE A BIG STRAWBERRY EGGO BUT FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE. To top it off my Husband got his SO-called chop steak and eggs...LMAO they brought him a fried HAMBURGER Patty dripping in grease! Sent it back, left and went to mcdonalds.... WAFFLE HOUSE MY ASS!!!!!!!!!!
