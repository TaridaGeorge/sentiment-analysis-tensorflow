I just don't get this place.  I know some people like it.....and I've given it more than 1 try.....but it's pretty simple -- the food is not that good.  Specifically, the pasta is cooked with a LOT of butter.....and cream sauces, which makes the meal fatty and filling.  In addition, the service is just not good.  We waited.....and waited.  We split a meal and they charged us to do it.

I don't recommend this place....and I won't be going back.
