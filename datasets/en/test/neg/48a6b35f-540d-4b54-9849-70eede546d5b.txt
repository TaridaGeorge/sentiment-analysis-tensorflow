I have eaten at this restaurant numerours times over the years. Tonight was my last meal. The food quality was poor, it reminded me of a meal that you would get at Denny's. The service experience was lacking.When i spend 40.00 for two people. I expect the food not to taste like it came out of can. This restaurant needs new management.
