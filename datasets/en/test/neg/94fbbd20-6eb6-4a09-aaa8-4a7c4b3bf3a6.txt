Save Yourselves!!  I am in Phoenix for a business conference. 15 of us went to lunch at Los Olivos. First of all, the food is mediocre at best, so don't bother with this place on that account. We had a fantastic meal at Macaulay's (sp?) in Tempe the day before. 
Now more importantly, 3 of the 15 of us have had raging diarrhea all day. The other two are vomiting as well. The only other food we all ate was doughnuts for breakfast. One of the three is a local resident so climate adjustment shouldn't be the issue. All three of us missed part or all of the conference today due to being sick.  Look, don't go here. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Do you need any more reasons?
Update: a fourth member has succumbed.
