I've been here twice - the first time, almost all of the local brews on tap were out. I tried to order more than 4 local brews, and they were completely tapped out. They only had the worst beers available. 

The second time I was there, I wanted to eat. They said that they were a "tapas restaurant" and only had small offerings. I got their baked shrimp for $12, and it was disgusting and small. I also ordered a diet coke, and it was completely flat when I got it. It was incredibly frustrating, and the service was terrible. I love City Scape, but if you're in the mood for a great place with good beers and drinks, either go to Tilted Kilt or Arrogant Butcher...this place won't last.
