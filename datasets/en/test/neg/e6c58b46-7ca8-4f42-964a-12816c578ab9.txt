Desperate for a bite to eat I passed this place and quickly turned into the drive-thru.  The building looked like it belonged in the midwest or even the dirty dirty so I ordered the fish sandwich which in my starving haze looked and sounded good but was horrible. I asked for no sauce. I get the sandwich and it's oozing with white mayo maybe? Tarter sauce? So bland and runny on top of the cod that tasted like it was still swimming in the ocean... I should have gone to the Sonic down the street or better yet nothing in the fast food category. Fast food disappoints!
