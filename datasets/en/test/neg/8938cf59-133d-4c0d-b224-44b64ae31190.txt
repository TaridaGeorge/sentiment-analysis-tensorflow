Sorry, but don't want to give this place any stars at all. I usually don't comment, but had to for this one. The location is in a really scary neighborhood. Hence, the reason for razor wire fences. I did go in and look around, but frankly, it gave me the creeps. I visited on Sunday afternoon.

First notice, nobody spoke English, (yes, my preference is to speak English), signs were all Spanish, individual stalls were extremely unattractive, and most mdse did not have prices marked, but I understand this is the preference of the sellers.

I am a veteran swap meet visitor, in many different locals and states all over the country. I
 just couldn't wait to get out of there. I hope it improves over time and wish the developers the best of luck.

For me, I will stick with the one in Mesa.
