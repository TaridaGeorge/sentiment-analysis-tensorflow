I have been to this location on several occasions and don't know why we keep going back. I guess we keep hoping for a good experience Truthfully, the food is good and the patio is a great place to go hang out and enjoy a Sunday afternoon.  The service on the other hand is horrendous. We had a server but never got to order food because after drinks were dropped, the server never came back. Ever. I wasn't there when the drinks were ordered so I literally never saw our server. Pretty unbelievable. I realize it was busy but seriously,  staff accordingly. That was our last attempt to enjoy ourselves at the Vig..never again.
