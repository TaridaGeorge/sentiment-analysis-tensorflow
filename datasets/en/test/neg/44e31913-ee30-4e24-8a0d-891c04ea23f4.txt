I actually want to rate 0, but apparently I cant. I have never been so utterly disgusted with a company until I was forced to deal with APS. Isnt it funny that there is NOTHING ANYONE can do about it?! Actually its not funny at all, its scary and wrong and unjustified. They have a monopoly on the power supply and they know it. They can do WHATEVER THEY WANT and there is nothing ANYONE can do about it.  (Unless of course you go off the grid completely, which isnt very practical for most people) I would love to lead an APS protest.
