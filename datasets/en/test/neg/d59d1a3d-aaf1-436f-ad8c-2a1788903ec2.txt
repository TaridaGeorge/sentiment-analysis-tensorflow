mediocre food at best and too overpriced for the lack of quality.  although my pulled pork sandwich was ok, 3 of my friends had to send their plates back because they were cold.  one of the steaks was completely undercooked.   i'm not a picky eater, but what i did notice about my experience was the ultimate lack of customer service on behalf of our waitress "kitty".  she just could not be bothered with the table and that is what ultimately set the tone for the experience.  she could have definitely made my score maybe one star higher, but the manager's offer of "a free desert", did not make things any better.  overall, i would never recommend this place to anyone even staying at the hotel! phoenix has far too many amazing restaurants in the same price range than to settle for this place.
