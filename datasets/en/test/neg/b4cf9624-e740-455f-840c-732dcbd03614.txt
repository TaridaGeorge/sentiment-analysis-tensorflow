First off, when you walk in it is too bright for a good bar atmosphere. The peanut shells on the floor everywhere remind me of a chain wanna be divey restaurant. Then waitress we had was pretty clueless, but tried to be nice, I guess. All in all, it was a wasted trip to what we thought was going to be a good hang out place.
