Over priced.. over seasoned.. slow service. That about sums Quiessence up. While the grounds are sort of romantic (think plant nursery meets your mom's backyard) its not charming enough to make up for the boring menu. 

While I can appreciate where they are coming from, "Slow" food does not mean that you have to wait for the food to grow while you sit there at the dining table.
