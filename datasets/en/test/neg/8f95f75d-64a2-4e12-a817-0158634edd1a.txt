Food was overpriced and mediocre at best.  Service was horrid.  We were greeted by one, order was taken by our main server, and food was served by yet another.  That and our actual server came back one time to ask if we needed anything, deemed our request unimportant and proceeded to never come back, but instead talked to the table behind us the whole time.  Won't be coming back.
