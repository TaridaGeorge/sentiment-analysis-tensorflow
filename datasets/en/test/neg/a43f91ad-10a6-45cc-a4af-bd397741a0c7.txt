Horrible. Rude service, little to no options for vegetarians, overpriced for portion size. Rock hard flavorless tomatoes, etc. My egg salad had shells in it. When I complained they looked at me like there was nothing wrong, no offer of a refund/replacement, just a shrug and "oh". Would not return, I always give restaurants a 2nd chance because mistakes do happen, but their complete lack of caring has resulted in a lost customer for life, they do not deserve a chance to redeem themselves.
