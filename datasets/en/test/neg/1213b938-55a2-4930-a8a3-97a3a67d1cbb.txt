This place wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so dirty! You can see a layer of filth on the cabinet doors behind the counter, between the glass and the sub making station, on the dressing bottles (that the server touches while making sandwiches), the floor, the tables, and even the one video game they have was filthy. I bought and ate a sub, anyway, and ended up with an upset stomach for the rest of the afternoon. I won't be going back.
