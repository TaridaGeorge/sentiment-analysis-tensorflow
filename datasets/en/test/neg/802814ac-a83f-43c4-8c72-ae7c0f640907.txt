They lost me as a listener when they ditched Chuck & Vincent's "Morning Ritual" several months ago (and apparently lots of other listeners, too.) That Adam Corolla guy is boring as hell. And they replay "Best Of" on the weekends, so no escaping him any mornings. Their musical repertoire is seriously on auto-pilot...the same predictable Red Hot Chili Pepper and Sublime and Foo Fighters songs over and over again. Boring. (And, no, why would I get Sirius/XM to hear the same boring alt crap I can hear for free?) Any time there's a new song, I never hear it ever again. Everything The Edge 103.9 should be playing, Jonathon L already gets to months in advance (*years* in advance, in some cases) on his Lopsided World of L across the dial.
