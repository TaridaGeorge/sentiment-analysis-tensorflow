Absolutely disgusted. I have never been treated so horrible by any customer representative- let alone a SUPERVISOR!! I was called about a USPS mix up, and then hung up on because I "did not let her finish"(supervisor) when I was actually agreeing with her point of view? Guess it did not matter that she cut me off four times when I was talking.. thats besides the point. The phone call went absolutely no where- I am still not sure why she called? I love Phil who delivers my mail and would never want to talk badly about him but the supervisor (who did not tell me her name) proved herself to be rude and incompetent. Hopefully someone will step in and make some changes in this place.
