Well, after my terrible experience with him screwing up the first 4 'microcavities', I didn't let him anywhere near the other 6 'microcavities' he claimed I had.  3 years later and still no 'full blown cavities' as this guy predicted.  He claimed that if I didn't let him put these phony 'micro-fillings' in my teeth, I would have full blown cavities in 6 months!
