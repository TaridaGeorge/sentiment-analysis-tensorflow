One star for convenience/location.
The short haired older lady is extremely rude. I was there today to get change for a $10 bill. She rolled her eyes at me, handed it to me and didn't say one word despite me being super friendly.  I hope she's not the manager/owner. That would be sad.
When I do need a convenience store and spend my $$.....I'll plan ahead & do it before I come up the hill.
