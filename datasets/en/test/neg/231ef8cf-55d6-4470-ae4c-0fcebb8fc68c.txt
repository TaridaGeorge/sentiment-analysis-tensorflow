My experience at Posh Nosh was awful.  Many of the food on the menu wasn't available.  The food that we did purchase was barely ediable.  The sauce tasted as though it came from a grocery store, the noodles were overcooked, and even the salad was awful.  The pastry purchased for dessert was dry and the iced tea was over-brewed.  I was also incredibly hungry prior to dining, which should have tilted my opinions in their favor.  My dining companion was just as hungry and disappointed, and had ordered a completely different meal.

The restaurant has the vibe of a cafeteria with slightly prettier walls.  I was particularly disappointed because the menu looked wonderful, and they had advertised pasties.

The website says that they are now only open by appointment only.
