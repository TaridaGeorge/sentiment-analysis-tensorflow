My first and possibly last experience with Hillstone, was so unfortunate. A late night dinner at the bar, we were exposed to a couple of waitresses, doing nothing but talking to the guys behind us, buying them drinks and talking about where they could meet up. I ended up leaving my phone at my seat, when I left and when I called, they said that it was not there. Knowing I had left it, I returned within 15 minutes, and not only was it still sitting where I left it, but so were my dirty dishes. I felt sorry for the people sitting next to it. I called the manager to tell him, that I had returned, and found my phone, and he said that "well, I asked!". I'm glad they changed the name, because it's a  disgrace to Houston's.
