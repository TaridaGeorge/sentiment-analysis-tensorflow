My friend and I came here a few nights backs for some bubble tea. Wow! Finding a place dedicated to bubble tea was surely a great find. We've tried a lot of places, some good, some not.

Well. This was the WORST bubble tea we'd ever tried. Watered down, horribly flavored and overcooked tapioca pearls. Blech!! After a few sips, we pitched the awful drinks and went out for frozen yogurt instead.

This is NOT how bubble tea (slushy type) should be.
