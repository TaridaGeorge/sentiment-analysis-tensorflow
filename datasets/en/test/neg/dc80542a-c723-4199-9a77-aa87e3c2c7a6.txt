I've never seen so many fat, ugly people working in one place and all of them doing nothing.  Yet another store that claims to carry PC games but couldn't tell me when or if ever they would carry a major-market PC game expansion.  This is my 2nd trip there, the last time they tried to sell me a laptop with Vista despite a quick explanation that we were just trying to see if they had any XP inventory.  

Ug.
