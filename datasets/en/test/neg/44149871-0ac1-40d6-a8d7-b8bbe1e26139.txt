We stopped by for some appetizers and boba/desserts before a dinner event.  All smoothies, boba or any dessert couldn't be done because the blender was broken.  So we just decided to order Egg rolls and Spring rolls.  The spring rolls were poorly made, loose and the sauce wasn't that good.  Both were small, it was ok for us as we didn't want to spoil for dinner, but they were tiny.  Then we shared fried banana dessert.  Banana used did not taste good, but came out hot... we were the only one there.  So the waiter was attentive...so that should be the only star.
