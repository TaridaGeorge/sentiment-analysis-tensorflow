I checked for this particular location of Bright Now Dental but apparently no one has had the pleasure of getting ripped off from this place yet. If you check the BBB you'll already know to stay away from this place. It's a factory designed to rip off people and thier insurance companies. I went in for a simple filling and came out with over 4k worth of expenses they said I "needed". I really thing the ADA should shut this place down, it's unprofessional and pretty seedy. I went to a real dentist and got my filling and that was all I needed, not the 4k worth of junk this place said I needed. STAY AWAY!
