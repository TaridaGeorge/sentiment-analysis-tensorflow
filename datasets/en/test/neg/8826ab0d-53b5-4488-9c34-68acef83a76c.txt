Went to dinner this past weekend with family to one of our "regular" places". We have found over the past year that Charleston's has not been near as consistent as it used to be. Our favorite meals seem to have lower quality meats and they have changed their menu so salads are no longer included.  It's really no longer an average priced place, but it's become very average food :(
