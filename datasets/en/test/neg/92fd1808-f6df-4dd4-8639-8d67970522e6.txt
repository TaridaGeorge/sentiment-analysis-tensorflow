Just one of the many typical, pretentious, overpriced and overhyped places in the Valley. The food is ok, but the way they treat you like you should be grateful to have experienced them is just beyond rude and simply not deserving of a place like this.  There are really too many other good places to eat in the Valley than to waste several hours at this joint.
