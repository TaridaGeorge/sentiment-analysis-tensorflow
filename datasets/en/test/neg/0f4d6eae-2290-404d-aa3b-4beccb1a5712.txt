I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?

I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.

Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one.
