You have to be kidding?   Sure, this place was a landmark in its day and WAS a great inexpensive treat but they have no doubt adopted a don't care attitude.  Antipasta plater with peppers, mushrooms in a sauce and bologna?  Please.  It went downhill from there.  The service is worse and the place is tired looking.   Head North to Lo Cascio's Italian Restaurant on Scottsdale Road, North Tempe.  Kitschy, sure, and you will love the owner with her over-the-top glasses yet when the food comes, now that's Italian.
