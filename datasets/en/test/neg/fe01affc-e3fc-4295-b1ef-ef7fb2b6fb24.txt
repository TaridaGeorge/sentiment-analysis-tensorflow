I've consistently found things that were either expired, about to expire, or have their expiration date completely erased with acetone to the point where I stopped shopping here. They profit from buying in bulk near-expired products from LA and flipping it here where competition is near zilch. Though it's closer to my home, I'd rather drive twice the distance to Lee Lee's where the turnover rates are higher and their selection more diverse. Nevertheless, this will not deter me from flying Asiana airlines.
