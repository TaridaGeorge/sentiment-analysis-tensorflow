I had a friend in town and we were looking for a nearby pizza place for carryout. I hadn't ever been to Hungry Howies, so decided to give this place a try... and after the one time, I think I'm done. The service was poor- a few high school aged kids that required me to repeat myself several times to get the order straight, and took 5 minutes to run a credit card through the register. The pizza itself was terrible as well. We opted for the original crust (they have flavors like parmasean cheese and garlic). It was a pan-style crust, but was hard as a rock... it might have required a trip to the dentist for a chipped tooth if I had tried any harder to bite into it.

If you're looking for carry-out, try Rosatis
