Well they keep bragging about how good their stuff is but it still tastes like sh*t. It is still worse than Pizza Hut and Papa Johns which is pretty bad because they are both crap too. It tastes like the same old crappy Dominos with extra salt and 10 cents worth of herbs added on and some garlic goop smeared on the crust. I'm not sure if it's any better, it's just different. That's about what I expected, but I'm still pissed. Also on my box it said "the road to enlightenment is paved with sliced italian sausage" and my inner Kwai Chang felt repulsed. "For all life is precious nor can any be replaced." A road of meat to enlightenment?! F- them.
