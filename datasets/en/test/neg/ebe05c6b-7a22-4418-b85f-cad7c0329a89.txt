Decided to try it as it's close by and an alternative to my normal place Zipps right around the corner.  Walked in to a customer yelling at the top of his lungs threatening to beat another bar customer up in front of his mother who was ordering food from the bar.  The staff decided that looking at the floor and bussing tables was more important than controlling the atmosphere so we looked around for a few minutes and decided Zipps was a much more mature alternative.  Can't speak to the food, drinks, or service since we left but if you're looking for a place where a bar fight doesn't seem to concern the staff or the customer's too much...this is your place.
