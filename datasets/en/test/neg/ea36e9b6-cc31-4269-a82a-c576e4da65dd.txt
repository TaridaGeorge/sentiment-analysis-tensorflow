I  went  to this  dealership on a  Sunday  afternoon  in order  to buy  a  new  Hyundai.   I   saw  only  one customer on the entire  lot  when I  arrived.  As  soon  as  I  tried  to  enter  the  building,  a  sales person,  Chris,    came  out   and  talked  to  me  in  a  very  hostile  way.   He  had  an  attitude  like  customers  are  his  personal  enemies -   I  was  wondering  how  these  guys  can  stay  in  business,  maybe  the  whole  thing  is  a  tax write off   ?

I  turned  around  and  walked  away  after  less  than  3  minutes  without  even  looking  at  one  of  their  cars.   This  was  by  far  the  worst  car  buying  experience  I  ever  had.
