Popped in here on a whim one day, and wandered around for a bit.  Didn't actually want to really touch much of anything, I felt like I was in that show "Hoarders" but the hoarder had OCD....so it was slightly organized filthy crap.

The furniture in the back looked so sad, I can't imagine any other Goodwill in the valley accepting it.  Most of it looked like it had been scavenged from next to dumpsters.

I did end up buying a few of the bags of cloth they have, but only because they are for sewing projects and I knew I could dump them in the washer and sterilize the crap out of them when I got home.  

I love going to thrift stores, but this was slumming at a level I could not have imagined.
