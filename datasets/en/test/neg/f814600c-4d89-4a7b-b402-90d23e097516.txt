I went to the location in Gilbert and came out with a big scratch on the hood of my car, the attendent gave me an incident report and said someone would call me, that was August 26th, still no call.  He also proceeded to be rude and tell me I am the only one that ever happened to and they would review the tapes.. Review away, I went in with no scratch and came out with a scratch..  I have left numerous messages on the phone no one answers..  Time to get the BBB involved and maybe notify the City on one of their business
