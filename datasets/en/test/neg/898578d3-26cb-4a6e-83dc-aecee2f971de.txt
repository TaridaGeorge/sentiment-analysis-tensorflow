Just spent over 15 minutes at a table waiting.  No waitress or waiter.  However, I was able to see up to 4 waitresses and a manager a table over eayupting and chatting while me and my friends waited.  AS We left we told the hostess why we were leaving in front of the manager and he said absolutely nothing.  Food....don't know s......drinks, don't know.......never got either.   Service..........AWFUL!!!!!!!  I will spread the word for you manager since you cannot talk!!!!!
