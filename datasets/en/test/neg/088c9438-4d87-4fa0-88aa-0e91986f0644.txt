This Marketplace portion of this Center, is great for sitting, hour after hour, in the water activity area, under the misters.

If its a shopping experience, you're after ....STAY AWAY.

Its loaded with skinhead type Teenagers, that gather in herds.
They are always blocking the walkways.
They are visually disgusting.
They'll degrade any positive experience, you might have from your visit. 

As I said earier, visit the water activity area ... when you have leisure time.
AVOID this center, otherwise.
