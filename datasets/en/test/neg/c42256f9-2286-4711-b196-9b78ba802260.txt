I was in the area and saw a coffee shop, so I stopped by for a quick cup. Well, that was difficult. I wish I had beforehand seen all of the fake 4/5-star reviews here and headed elsewhere.

In short:
Everything will likely be broken.
You're not allowed to make any changes to your beverage, because the place is run by a bunch of pretentious ninnies who believe their product is the epitome of.. whatever it is that they are attempting to do (the word "swindle" comes to mind).
Oh, and the end result will be mediocre.

Head elsewhere. Do not be swayed by their interesting-looking wooden sign. The inner design is nice, however. If you hate coffee, enjoy the atmosphere of pompous hipster foolery, and just want to hang out inside with a friend or two, this may be the place for you.
