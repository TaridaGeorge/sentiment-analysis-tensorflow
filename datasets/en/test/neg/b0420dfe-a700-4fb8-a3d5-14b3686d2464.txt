We have been going to this Cracker Barrel for a year and a half, since we moved here and it progressively gets worse. The last four times the biscuits were so hard they could be used as hockey pucks. The kitchen help and the waitresses have to know that the biscuits are no longer fresh and need to be thrown away. The gravy was the consistancy of mached potatoes and the hasbrown casserole was dried out  beyond salvation. If the management doesn't open there eyes this place will soon be a ghost town. I will wait several weeks and see if they read this and make the necessary changes, if not, my money spends elsewhere.
