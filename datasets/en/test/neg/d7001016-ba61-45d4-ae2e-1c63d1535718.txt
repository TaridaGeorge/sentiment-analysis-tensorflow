I decided to stop by on my way back from ABC decorations.  I saw the place was busy so must mean pretty good food?  Yeah, I was wrong.  Ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl, you cannot go that wrong with it.  The sauce was so sweet.  It was like eating maple sauce with chicken and rice.  Too sweet for my taste.  I should have read the Yelp review before I went there.
