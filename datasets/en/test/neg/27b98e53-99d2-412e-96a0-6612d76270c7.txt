This review can not comment on the food at Alexi's because frankly we left.

We patiently waited for over 10 minutes for a waiter to ask us about drinks or bring a menu, no dice. They seemed understaffed and had a large group, but that is no excuse for completely ignoring a table.

I was also shocked at the causal attire of some of the guests. I realize its summer and all, but the table next to us one gentleman was in a white tank top. Not my expectation for this type of restaurant.

So while we didn't dine at Alexi's, we did patron the owner's other restaurant and had a wonderful experience (as we always do).
