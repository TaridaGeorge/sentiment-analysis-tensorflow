I just moved here from Kansas and have been looking for a good BBQ joint.  We ordered the lunch special, which was a choice of a beef or pork sandwich with coleslaw and fries. We also got an order of rib tips. The food took forever, and there were only two other couples there. The  sandwich was tiny and served on a regular hamburger bun. The fries were average, and the coleslaw had zero flavor. The rib tips were cold inside. When I told the waitress, she apologized and said that they come frozen. She said that they get steamed before coming out.  I couldn't believe that a BBQ restaurant would have frozen meat. WTH?  This place was so disappointing.  I will not be coming back.
