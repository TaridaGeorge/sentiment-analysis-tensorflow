This would be the perfect place to see a bunch of old broads crowing about the Sex and The City movie, comparing themselves to fictional, empty, pathetic, meaningless women, and guffawing over a disappointing assortment of wines about how the sequel better show a full-frontal of Big (unless the first film had it, I wouldn't know.  *shrug*)

The only thing more of a headache than Old Town Scottsdale is Old Money Scottsdale.

Skip it unless you are an old broad or have future aspirations to become one.

The service sucks too.
