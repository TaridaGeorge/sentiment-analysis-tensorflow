If you prefer to spend your hard earned money at a place that respects one with a medical condition this.is not the restaurant for you.  The.night manager is an angry woman who will not hesitate to yell at you and to embarrass you by making a scene in her own restaurant.   Why anyone would frequent a place like this is beyond me since mgmt is a reflection of who and what the owners value.  All are not welcome here.
