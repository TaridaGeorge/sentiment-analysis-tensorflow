Worst service at a Starbucks I have ever experienced.  Keesh was rude and I will never recommend nor go to that Starbucks ever again.  The sad thing is there are way too many Starbucks with friendly good hearted people for me to put up with this particular negative store.  The coffee is the same in every store so why not go to another Starbucks or even The Coffee Bean.  I was so disrespected they received a comment/complaint on the corporate website from me.

One chance is all they got.
