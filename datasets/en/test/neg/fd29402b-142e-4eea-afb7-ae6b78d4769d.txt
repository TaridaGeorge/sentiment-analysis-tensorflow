This place sucks balls. I can't believe it is still open. I went here one day while I was installing a alarm system in a house around the area. Took them 45 min to bring out 2 slices of pizza by that point i was going to walk out the door. 

blandest pizza i have ever tasted. i don't know how this place is still open. never again. horrible service, horrible food.
