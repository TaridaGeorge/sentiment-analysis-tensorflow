We drove up this morning and were a bit confused to find the cafe closed. Several other people were there staring at the deserted cafe and wondering where the staff was. We had all read this message on the cafe's website:

"From 6/4 to 6/19 Morning Glory will only be Open on Weekends."

Wouldn't you think that means they are still open on Thursday June 2nd?  Apparently, they meant to say "closed weekdays starting 5/30", but aren't so good with the English language.

Oh well, it's a beautiful farm and almost worth driving out here just for the scenery. Ok, not really. If you are reading this, Morning Glory owners, please learn to communicate your seasonal closing dates  correctly next year.
