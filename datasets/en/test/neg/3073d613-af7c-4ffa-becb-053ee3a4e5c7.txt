If I could put no star, ....no star at all!! The worst customer service ever. I love Lush products and been using for almost 4 yrs. This location, one of the lady is very rude and doesn't have any clue what the customer service is. She gave me the product that she dropped on the floor (it's Angel Barefoot facial cleanser mud).
She didn't even say "thank you" or anything but gave me bad attitude. 

This is not acceptable at all.
If you want to get Lush product in PHX area, go to Chandler fashion mall. It worth to drive, they are such a sweet heart and great customer service, I can see they really love Lush product.
