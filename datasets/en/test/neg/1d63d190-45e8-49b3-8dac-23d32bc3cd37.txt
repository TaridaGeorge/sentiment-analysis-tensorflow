I was so disappointed! I bought 8 cupcakes all different. The one I ate (white cale with chocolate frosting and hershey drop on top) tasted like box cake mix and can frosting! So disappointing when I paid $25 for them! All the kids said they were just okay and told me not to get them again. The birthday girl said it was dry cake and too sweet frosting! Save your money and make box cupcakes on your own!
