Showed up 15 min before opening, 50 people were already waiting. We were a party of 6 and were given a 2 hour + wait time!! Not a good place for parties over 4, sweet spot is a party of two. I would recommend arriving 30 min before opening, to ensure you get in. Have eaten there before, food is outstanding.... But extremely hard to justify the wait.
