**Update*** NEW updated review will be submitted in the near future. I will include that my final rating has NOT changed. Still a 1 becasue I cannot give it any less through Yelp rating. (PENDING REVIEW.)

I have a rental for the week. However, I can contest to John S. review as well as many others with the very low reviews for Budget on Sky Harbor Circle. He is absolutely correct about the "upsell me after I had prepaid for everything online." My point of view HIGHLY annoying as well as extremely ridiculous. I will be providing a rundown of everything that was pitched to me for additional purchase as a daily additional charge.
