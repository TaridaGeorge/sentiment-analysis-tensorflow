Had to stop here for connecting flight coming from cancun. After customs, u have to physically get ur luggage (the one u checked-in) from the carousel, then check it again for your connecting flight. The problem i encountered was going to security again to go to the gate for my connecting flight. The security specifically shouted to everybody that we need to take out all liquid we brought and place it on top of our bags as it entered into the scanner. This caused so much hassle because i didnt expect they demand such a thing. I fly a lot and this was the first time they demand such. Of course since i didnt know, the specific liquid (mouthwash) was at the bottom of my bag and i have to remove all my stuff out of the bag to get it..urgghhhh!!
