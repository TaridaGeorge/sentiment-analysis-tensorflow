We had heard so much about smashbuger and their grand opening at Desert Ridge so we decided to give it a shot. There was a normal sized line that took longer then expected. When we finally got to the cashier we order two chicken sandwiches with a few condiments... it took over 30 minutes to get our food AFTER we ordered. To top it off the chicken on the sandwiches were thinner than even the tomatoes! I mean I know they're called SMASHburger, but seriously. After the long wait, skimpy chicken and stingy condiments we will not go back.
