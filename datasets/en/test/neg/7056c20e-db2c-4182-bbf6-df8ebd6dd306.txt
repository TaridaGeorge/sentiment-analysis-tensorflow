I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Several negatives affect this review:

1. My car was broken into! This is a "gated" community where the gate doesn't work half of the time!
2. The apartment staff don't seem to care about their renters. Maintenance is a second thought, with little to no urgency. When asking about a piece of mail that was delivered to the office, they seemed to have no idea where it could have gone and keep no log of incoming or outgoing mail. On top of that, they didn't care enough to find the mail!
3. Grounds are kept at a minimum. Dog bags are refilled occasionally, bushes are cut haphazardly. Overall, just unkempt.

I'd say stay away from this place!!
