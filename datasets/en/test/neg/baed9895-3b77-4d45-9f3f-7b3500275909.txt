This company charged me $100 to fix a slow leak on a bathroom faucet. It took then less than 5 minutes of work then started leaking again a couple of months later. I called to see if they would fix it again and, of course, it was going to be another $100 for the same problem they failed to fix. They transferred me 4 times to a line that constantly rang and I had to all back. Staff was really rude and when I explained I didn't think it was fair to charge me full price again they could have cared less.
