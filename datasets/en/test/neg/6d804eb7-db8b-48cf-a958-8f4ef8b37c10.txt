I have some family down in Arizona and I used to love going to Moreno's for some good Mexican food with the family. However, recently things have gone downhill and fast. This restaurant is booming during the lunch rush and while plenty of staff used to be available to help out hungry customers, now there is just one guy running around trying to serve everyone! The wait is excruciating and by the time I get my food it's already cold. I understand trying to cut costs, but this is ridiculous!
