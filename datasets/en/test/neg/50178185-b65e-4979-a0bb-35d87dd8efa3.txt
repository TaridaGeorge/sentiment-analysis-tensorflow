Came in to have glasses repaired.  Ended up with cosmetic damage on the exterior of the frames.  These are $600 frames.  Repair tech offered $10 off, but frames are still damaged.  Did not make the customer whole after ruining the cosmetics of the frame.   Will not repeat business here.  Beware of the condition of your sunglasses before you drop them off...they will surely come out in a much different condition after they are "fixed."
