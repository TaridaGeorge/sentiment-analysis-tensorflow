I've had the same problem with this restaurant that others here have had. The service is essentially non-existent and the food comes out cold/lukewarm and of low quality. However spicy you make your food, it's still somehow obvious that it's just not good.

I recommend driving down the street to Tandoori Times instead. The food, service, and experience is infinitely better.
