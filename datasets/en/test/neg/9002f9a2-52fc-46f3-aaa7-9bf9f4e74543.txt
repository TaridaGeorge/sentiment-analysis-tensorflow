While the food is great, the management is horrible.  My teenage daughter is an employee there.  Last Sunday, while she was cleaning the bathrooms, several patrons left and three tables needed to be cleaned.  My daughter was unaware of the dirty tables as she was in  the midst of doing another part of her job.
The store manager proceeded to yell at her in front of customers and coworkers, threatening her job if it ever happened again.
Her supervisor did NOT defend her whereabouts because supposedly, the manager will dock her pay if she speaks on behalf of the employees.
No wonder they can't keep employees at this store.
