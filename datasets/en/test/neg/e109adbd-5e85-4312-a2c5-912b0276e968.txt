This is a weird Walmart in a Weird mall.  Everything about this place gives me the Hebe-jeebees.

I saw a couple having a domestic dispute in the toy isle.  Listened to several screaming children and wasn't greeted by the greeter.

I took my mom here and was afraid someone would step to her and I would have to beat them down.  (You don't mess with my mama)

Maybe if you think of this Walmart as some sort of ghost-hunter adventure you night really have fun, I guess.
