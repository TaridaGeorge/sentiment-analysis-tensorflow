After checking with the front desk on how to find the rooms. Odd on this side and even on that side???? Then ac in only one room( we had a suite) &the one bedroom didn't have a Tv plus the Tv ( living room)was an older style.  The refrigerator wasn't on so now we put our stuff in the freezer.  We are glad we are only here for the weekend and will not return to this one:-( also keep your shoes on....total black feet( carpet needs a good shampoo). The breakfast was good but needs to be restocked earlier. Also the keys didn't work 3 & the front desk wasn't too helpful. Plus the pool isn't 24 hrs but at 230 in the morning people were swimming.... if you stay here which id advise you dont- stay away from pool side
