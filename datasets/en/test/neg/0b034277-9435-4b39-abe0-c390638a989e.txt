food ended up decent, but not great. 1 star is because there was no soap in the mens rooms, and the manager (who I found out was the owner) shrugged it off like it was no big deal.

I'm not sure if this the same restroom the employees use, but if it is, I'm pretty sure that bad for the health code.

And I asked for no onions, and 1 second later he put onions on it. Not the end of the world, but he (yes the owner) just wasn't paying attn.
