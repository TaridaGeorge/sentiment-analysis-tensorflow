The only reason I will be going here is that it's the closest gym to my house.  After my free 1 hour personal training session that came with joining, it will take all my energy to walk back into that place.

I've never seen such high pressure sales tactics.  The dude trying to sell me their outrageously expensive personal training packages just wouldn't take no for an anwer.  When I said I needed to ask my husband about the extra money, he said "I'm disappointed that your husband doesn't support you and you have to ask him about that kind of thing."  What an a-hole.  I walked out at that point (before I ripped his face off).
