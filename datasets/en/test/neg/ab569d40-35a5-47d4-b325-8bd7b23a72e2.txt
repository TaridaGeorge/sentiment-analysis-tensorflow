this is my first 1 star review


it used to be that i could place an internet order and instantly know that it would be correctly done to my specifications in the time that i requested it in.
Recently:  i don't know who the buffoon's are that the now "fedex kinko's"
hired, but the last three orders i put in not only sucked, it took
decades for these people to find and although i left my phone number in bold for them to call if there were any questions, they sent me three emails instead of calling me
. 
whooo i ask you sits at their inbox waiting for a response from kinkos?
these people are idiots.
i will be going to the washington one from now on.
