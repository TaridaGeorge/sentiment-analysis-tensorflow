I don't review often, but I am still sitting at my table here at Grimaldis and I had to write this review. The pizza i just attempted to chew here at Grimaldis at Park West was less than average. The crust was supposed to be the best part and it was not at all. It was so chewy that me and my partner could barely chew it. The toppings were sparingly and they charge for every topping ($2).  I Have eaten at Grimaldis in Scottsdale and it was much better. I would much rather have had pizza hut than this. I love pizzeria bianco and rays of ny. I hope mgr here sees this and figures it out soon.
