Went with friends to Brad's Place, Elliot Rd. in Phoenix on 12/21/2010. We arrived at 6:15 PM and the place was half filled. We placed our food order and finally had to asked where the food was, 30 minutes later. The server said it would be coming up in 5 minutes, the second time she had said that. I finally went to the kitchen ans asked where our food was. The cook(who was dressed like he was homeless and dirty) said 5 minutes but there was no plates on the prep counter. I went back to our table and said, "we are leaving". I do not know what happened at do not care but we went to Keegans on Ray Road and the service was 100 times better than Brad's.
