I asked for a straw for my water and the server told me that they aren't allowed to give out straws anymore, that it "came from the top".  Meanwhile, my boyfriend sees a glass at the bar completely filled with straws (as well as bar sitting customers' drinks with straws) so he gets up and takes one.  The next thing we know, someone has put the glass of straws out of sight.  The server comes to check on us, notices the straw in my drink and asks me where I got it.  Are you kidding me???  At $40+ a person she is going to interrogate me about a straw?  How dare they!!!!  

Well they just lost previously loyal customers who have been coming her for over 18 years!!!!
