I ate at this restaurant for my first and last time this past weekend.

The service was horrible.  The waitress spilled coffee on the table more than once.  There was no one refilling water glasses.  I had to walk around the restaurant to find a waitress to fulfill my requests.  Unacceptable.

The food was not much better.  One person in my party received a plate of food he did not order which was corrected after ten additional minutes of waiting.  The scrambled eggs were burned and the omelets were undercooked.  The food is overpriced for what you receive.

The only good thing I can say about this restaurant is that it's clean.  There are much better options in the area.
