Simply awful.  We had heard a few people rave about this place, and now I wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage.  The "cheese" is this awful petroleum grease product with yellow color.  That was the worst of it, but nothing was good at all.  And crazy price to boot.
