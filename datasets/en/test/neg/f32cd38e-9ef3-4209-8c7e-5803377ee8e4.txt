Well we came in on fathers day. The servers and bartenders defiantly didn't want to be here..

1. The cooler was down but they manage to work around that and had chilled glasses and stuck our tecate in some ice for a few minutes. 

2. Food was bland. And once again, another "New Mexican" rest. That taste like white people bland food. 

If you don't know what hatch, hot, green or   Red means--this place might be for you. If your a NM native- go to taco bell.
