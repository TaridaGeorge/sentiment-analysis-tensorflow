First time here to watch some live music (co-workers of mine). This bar does not approve of alternative lifestyles. 
I was kissing my girlfriend, not pronographic stuff going on, simply kissing and we were told by a waitress named Ash to "cool it".

I will NEVER go back. I have never been absurd or inappropriate in public and for them to come out and tell us to "cool it", because someone's wife complained...this is not okay.
I will definitely spread the word through my industry.
