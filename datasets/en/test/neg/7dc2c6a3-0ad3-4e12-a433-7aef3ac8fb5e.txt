Worst McDonald's ever. It's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right, but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth. Food is usually cold anyway. But it's  their management that's the worst. They treat you like the idiot, when it's their fault to begin with. If you call the posted customer service number, don't bother it's a recording and still have not received a callback. Avoid at all costs.
