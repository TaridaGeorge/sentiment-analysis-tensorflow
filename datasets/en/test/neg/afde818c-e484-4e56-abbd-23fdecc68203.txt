The food was what I would expect from Applebees & the service was fair, however I checked my credit card a few days later I realized I was overcharged.  I called the manager and was talked down to and shamed for complaining about being charged 1.50 more than my bill.  When I told the manager that it wasn't the dollar amount that mattered it was that my credit card was charged for something I didn't sign for, he was rude and said that he was sending me the dollar fifty what else did I want.  I was not angry when I called but furious when I hung up.  I will never give my business here again, especially when every other chain restaurant is located within 5 miles.
