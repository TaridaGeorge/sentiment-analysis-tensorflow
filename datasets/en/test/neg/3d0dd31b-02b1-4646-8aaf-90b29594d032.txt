Don't bother with these folks. I called them because they came up as $20 on a google search. But when I called them, they said it would be $75 even though our tenant was right down the street from them. When I asked about the $20, they said that was just their name, not their price. What a rip! I told them I thought that was misleading and false advertising and hung up. I found a process server who did the job for $50.
