I have been going to the open-air Saturday market for a while, but have never gone into the store. I have always had a pleasant time and the sellers are always friendly and helpful. 

In contrast to the friendly merchants outside, the grocery store people were not, at least not to me and the person I was with. Answering a question seemed like a chore to the girl behind the counter. Then the cashier, although superbly pleasant to the person checking out before us, did not provide the same to us. We are probably not the kind of customers they like or are used to?

I'll probably continue to go to the open-air Saturday market but definitely skip the store.
