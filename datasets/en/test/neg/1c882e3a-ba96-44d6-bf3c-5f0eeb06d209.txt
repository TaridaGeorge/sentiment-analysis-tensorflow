My rating was going to be for E4 which is curently closed... I hope the owners read this and make some changes.  Through the grapevine I heard that one of the owners sold their liquor license (idiot thing to do for a nightclub in old town) and its now revamped as an 18+ club called afterlife... yay just what I always wanted.  A starbucks that you need to pay 20 dollar cover to walk around in.  Seriously... change it back.  I miss the old E4, it was my favorite chill spot and I would patronize it several times a week.  The bartenders were always awesome, the doorguys cool as can be and now... they have arcade games on the patio... FAIL!
