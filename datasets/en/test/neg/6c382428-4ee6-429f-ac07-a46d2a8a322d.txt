Been going here for 20 years, food is good, service is adequate. On our last visit we ordered a beer and glass of wine. Upon receiving the Chardonnay, we noticed the color was off, and after the first sip, the taste was way off. We asked they take the wine back, we were told they will still be charging us for it because they "cannot pour it back in the box". After speaking with the owner and expressing our dissatisfaction, he refused to credit the bill. A truly poor management decision, which in turn has effected out decision to go back, ever again. $4.50 is more important to this business than a loyal customer.
