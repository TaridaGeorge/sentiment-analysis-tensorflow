I really don't understand how there can be this many positive reviews of this place.  The gyro was sub par, very little meat and the tzatziki was watery.  The chicken schawarma had an odd taste to it as well.  I would rate Gyro Express and the Hungry Monk wayyyy better and they are both within a mile of this place.  Save your cash, go anyplace else.
