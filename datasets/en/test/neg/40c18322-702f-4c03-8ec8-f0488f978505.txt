Taliesin West is a fascinating chapter in American architecture.  It is a welcomed departure from Phoenix's endless strip malls and air-conditioned overbuilt refuges from the desert.    However, as a visitor destination, it exudes a military harshness toward guests that has caused me to skip out early, like a repulsive force-field.
The visitor center  is the only spot on site that is free to those willing to make the trek out here.   It is stocked with a wide array of Wright -embellished paraphernalia.  Its generous stock of commercial products contrasts starkly the haughty manner in which curious visitors are handled.
Should the Nordstrom customer service gods visit the Frank Lloyd Wright staff and give them a lesson or two to make this destination a pleasant experience.
