this is a place you have to seat yourself. There was no talking involved other than the waiter asking us what we want to order. The guy who drop off the food just put it down and left, we had to figure out which one was which. No water refills, flies visited our table often (not sure if  this is normal for the phoenix area because the door was open). We ordered pho, my friend liked it but I didn't because the soup tasted sweeter than I usual have it. The place seems pretty popular there were people coming in and out. When paying, you have to walk up to the counter yourself and pay. There was no service to speak of.
