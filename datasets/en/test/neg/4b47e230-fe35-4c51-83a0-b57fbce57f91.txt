Ok, i am going to apologize in advance to all those nice folks who like this place - you got jeeped!!! 

This was one of the MOST unappetizing lunch i had in the looong time. Cold rice, bland chicken, non-friendly service, somewhat expensive. "Not spicy 'nogh fo' yo? I bring hot sauce!" HUH? WTF. I do not want hot sauce, i want properly prepared dish. 
I never came back and neither i intend to .

"I no like"
