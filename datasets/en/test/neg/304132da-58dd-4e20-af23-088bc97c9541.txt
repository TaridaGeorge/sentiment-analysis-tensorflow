These guys are CRIMINALS! They recently decided that they do not rotate tires if they are remotely worn. What really? Oh you mean you don't rotate tires so I have to buy them more often from you guys. So if they won't rotate them because of this new usage rule shouldn't they give me new tires (mine are less than 1 year old) so I can start following your NAZI rotation guidelines. SHAME ON YOU DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!!!
