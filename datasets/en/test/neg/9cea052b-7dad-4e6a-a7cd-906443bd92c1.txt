Place sucks. Right when we went it, we showed out Restaurant.com gift certificate, and they rejected us because it was a weekend. No where on the gift certificate does it say anything about using it on the weekday. So there service isn't great, it was dead in there... no customers and they still didn't take our gift certificate... bad business to turn customers away especially when there's no one in there. Haven't even got to try the food... darn.
