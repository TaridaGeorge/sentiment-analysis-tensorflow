I enjoyed the pizza, and yes...the beers are tasty but $6/$7 & $8 prices are more geared for lawyer's & doctors who want to show off their college degree. I'll stick to my side of the tracks where I can get a beer for $3...tops!  No Happy Hour..??  Lower the alcohol prices if you want this cowboy to return. Bathrooms were clean..plenty of toilet paper!
