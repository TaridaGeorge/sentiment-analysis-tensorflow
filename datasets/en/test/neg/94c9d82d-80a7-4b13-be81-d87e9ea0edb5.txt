Just moved out here from San Francisco. I thought prices for alterations were expensive there but its way more here. I did not agree with prepaying for a hem job and the lady promptly snapped at me saying a lady early in the day made a $300 prepayment with no issues. Hmm thanks for belittling me. Nonetheless I won't be going back here. Only reason I dropped off a pair of pants is because of time constraints.
