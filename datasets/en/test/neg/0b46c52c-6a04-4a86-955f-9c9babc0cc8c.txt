I rescind my 2-star vote and wish I could give them negative stars.  It is clear this is just a room designed to do one thing: make the promoters and owners money.

Wise up people.  A venue that doesn't have working AC in AZ isn't worth your couch cushion pennies.  When a credit/debit card is a chore at the bar, take your plastic elsewhere.  When the band themselves complain, you are in THE WRONG VENUE.

If you're a touring musician reading this, contact your promoter and ask to be rebooked elsewhere.  This place is a joke and it's embarrassing to the local music scene.

Don't settle for this Arizona.  We can do better.
