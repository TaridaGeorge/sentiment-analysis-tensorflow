Just to make this clear on how bad this place sucks for karaoke, I am on my iPhone right now while I am here to right a review. I got off work at 10 and came by here for the first time cause I heard this place was awesome for karaoke. Little did I realize HOW wrong everyone was. I walk in and my ears start to bleed. The singers were a collection of the worst singers I've eve heard. The crowd was mainly made up of people twice my age, and I'm 26. The drink specials were decent but the bar was SMALL!  There are MAYBE 10 tables in the whole bar. I will NEVER come back here unless for some reason I really want to feel better about myself.
