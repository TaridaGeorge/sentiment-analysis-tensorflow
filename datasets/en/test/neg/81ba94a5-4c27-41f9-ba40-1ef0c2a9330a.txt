Non-existent customer service. Quite literally. I walk up to the desk, the guy working there ignores up - I'm standing at the counter inches from where he just finished ringing up a customer - when I get to the counter, he turns away from me and walks away. Walks. Away. From. A. Customer. Like I have cooties or  something. WTF? I'll go elsewhere for my haircut.
