took my daughter for a fun night out. it wasnt fun. we sat infront of the stage with our backs to it no chance to turn the chairs.  actors waved capes in our face or their backs were to our face. then there was the food, the chicken was processed and formed , i can go to mcdonalds for that. drinks were from the bar so couldnt even afford ice tea no refills. and before we could even take our seat we each had to pay a $5.00 tip.  would not recomend or return.
