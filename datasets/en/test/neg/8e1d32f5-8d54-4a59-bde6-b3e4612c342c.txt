Went to see the Sun Devils Game. It took at least 15 minutes to get a beer. The server forgot my order twice, and it took over an hour to get my burger and fries. It took forever to get the check. Wondered why my stomach starting hurting a couple hours later. Noticed the next morning the other half of the burger was raw inside. They did comp my burger, but it wasn't enough. Bad food, bad service!
