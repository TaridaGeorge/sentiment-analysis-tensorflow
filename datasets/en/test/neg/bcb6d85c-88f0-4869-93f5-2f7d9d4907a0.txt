After 4 days of getting the run-around from multiple 'managers' I was told the part that was ordered did not come in, and that it would be another 3 days wait. My car is no longer drivable due largely to the repeated mishandling of the idler pulley replacement. 

I have requested a refund in full and will be taking my vehicle to another service. Save your money, time and sanity, stay away from this Midas.
