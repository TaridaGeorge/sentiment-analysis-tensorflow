So I took my 2003  pontiac Grandprix in for some work( new catalytic convertor o2 sensor and a tune up)  $840 dollars worth of work.  About 2 weeks after the work I get a check engine light so I take it in to get scanned and it ends up being one of my cylinders not firing  so i pull the plug wire, and the boot is broken and taped on there. makes you wonder if they skimp on a 20 dollar part they break where else do they cut corners?  I would not recommend there service to anyone.
