Another review of AT&T wireless....not the store.  This may be a record; they lasted less than 2 hrs for me!  After 12 years w/Verizon I decided to leave so I could get an iPhone.  GIANT mistake.  I called to activate my phone, and was told the activation dept. is CLOSED.  I called customer service, and got it connected.  But then I called Mom and she asked why I was calling from her cell phone number?  They got the numbers attached to the WRONG PHONES.  So I called customer service back, and THEY WERE CLOSED.  It was 7pm here.  I dont care what time it was on the east coast...if their customer service dept (and tech support) cant be open when i need them, then i dont need them.  I'm going back to Verizon and im never leaving again!
