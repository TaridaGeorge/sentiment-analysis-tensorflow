I'm shocked to see that this place has an average of 4 stars!! This place sucked. We ordered the crab puffs, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and egg drop soup. Everything was gross. The crab puffs were soggy and burnt, the sweet and sour chicken was somewhat decent but the sauce was sooo watered down. The fried rice was so greasy and had a weird flavor, and the egg drop soup was by far the worst. It tasted like someone used leftover water from cleaning dishes to make it. It was so nasty. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT reccommend this place.
