My guests and I were seated and we asked for bread, as one couple had just gotten off a plane and they  were starved.  We got it 20 minutes later after asking 3 more times and threatening to leave.

The Calamari appetizer was the worst ever.  50% of the plate (not exagearting) was old breading, and the calamari was tough and overcooked.

I ordered the Shrimp Risotto, which used to come with shrimp and scallops.   No more scallops.  But of course they raised the price on the dish anyway.   Welcome to new American dining.   Cut the food.  Raise the prices.

Brio presents a nice atmosphere because it was physically well designed.  Problem is, they forgot to hire anyone who can cook or provide nice table service.
