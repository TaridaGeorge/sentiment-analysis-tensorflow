This place is weird. They are an "Italian/Mexican" restaurant. Maybe its me, but I don't need my tacos from the same guy that makes my spaghetti.
 I had the gyro sandwich. The gyro meat was average and the tzatziki sauce was bland. I also thought $7 for the sandwich was too much too.
Haji baba's in Tempe is still the best gyro around.
