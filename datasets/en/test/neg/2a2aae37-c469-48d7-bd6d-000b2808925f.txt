It's an OK place to go. Last time we went, one of the machines was broken and when we swiped our card (twice), it took the credits but wouldn't let us play. So we asked for a refund on our lost credits. They said they had to have a manger do it. It took 20 minutes for the manager to get to us. He stopped and chatted with people on the way. When he did arrive, he did not even acknowledge us or apologize. He just looked like a big jerk. Plus we had our 2 year old with us and she wanted to play not wait for 20 minutes for something that wasn't even our fault. It can be a fun place but the employees are stupid and don't give a crap.
