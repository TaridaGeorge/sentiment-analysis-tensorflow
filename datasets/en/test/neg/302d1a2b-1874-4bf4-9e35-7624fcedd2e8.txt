Still sickening. Really. I got sick twice here. I tried this place again because other friends of mine say that they really like it.  Apparently, they are not eating at the one in Maricopa.  I should know better when they still do not know what oregano is when I ask for it.  I recently also went to a Barro's in Mesa and I had not a problem.  It was fabulous!  So maybe it is JUST this one... I am just unlucky here?
