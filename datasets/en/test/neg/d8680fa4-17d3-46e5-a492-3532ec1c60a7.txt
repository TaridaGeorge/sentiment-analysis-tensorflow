Hey, people just a question because I haven't been in that place for years. Is the owners FAT piano leg daughter [Shannon] still work there? Boy she was nice to people that lived nearby & tipped her::::::::::"NOT"!  Memories is hard to forget, she was just awful most of the times. I meant her mom onetime as a fill-in on a Saturday, yes she was bitchy like her daughter. At onetime I brought up the establishment for conversation & really people said the same thing [Shannon] & I wasn't surprise.
