Are you kidding me .60 extra  for a piece a cheese on an already overpriced burger, $1.00 extra for curly fries is it just me or should they call this "sucker burger. The staff looked like extras from the movie Scarface with manners to match . Save your money and go to In-N-Out, Five Guys, or better yet for the same money at "sucker burger" you could be treated like a real person with your delicious burger brought to your table at Blu Burger in North Scottsdale. FYI ladies my wife said "no soap" in restroom.
