Went back to NNY for football. I figured since everyone was complaining about the Wifi almost a month later it would be fixed. Talked to the bartender and some friends I know who confirmed it hadn't been touched. Still lots of people complaining. Such a shame because the staff is great, the beer  is cold and the food is good. After 1 quarter my friends and I left along with a few others and went across the street so we could get online. Come on guys even the NFL is wiring 12 stadiums this year for fans to get online at the game. Its money walking out the door.
