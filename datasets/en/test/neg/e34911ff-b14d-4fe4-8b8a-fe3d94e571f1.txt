Very disappointing!  No room cleaning for 2 out of the 6 days.  Very noisy.  I would not recommended nor stay here again.  My husband and I returned one evening around 6:30pm and found the door to our room wide open and no one around!!  Next few days we found a note on the door that said that we had the do not dIstrub sign on which we did not and that our room was not cleaned (liars)!
