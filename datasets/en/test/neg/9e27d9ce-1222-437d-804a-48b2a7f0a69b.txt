On a 6-hour flight to Hawaii, US Airways ran out of food! We were starving, because we didn't have time to grab food before the flight, so we were expecting to be able to purchase food once in the air. Since we were sitting in the back of the plane, all of the food was gone by the time they rolled their cart to us. Our lunch consisted of chips, almonds and cookies; these were basically our rations for 6 hours. Our first four choices of real food (ex: sandwich, salad, cheese/fruit, etc), were sold out. Plus, the flight attendants were less than friendly (to be fair, maybe it was just one in particular that was having a very bad day). Overall, we often dislike our experiences with US Airways, and will avoid them as much as possible.
