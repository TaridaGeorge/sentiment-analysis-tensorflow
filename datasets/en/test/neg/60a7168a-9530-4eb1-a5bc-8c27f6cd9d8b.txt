Don't waste your time here. First, there aren't many chocolate vendors. Second, the vendors selling chocolate are selling the same thing. It was pretty cheesy and disappointing. To make it worse, the quality of chocolate was sub par. As others have mentioned - traffic is horrific.... made worse by the number of over weight people waddling around trying to find the few chocolate vendors. The number of vendors selling trinkets FAR out numbered the vendors selling chocolate. They need to re-name this fest something else to more accurately describe what you should be expecting.
