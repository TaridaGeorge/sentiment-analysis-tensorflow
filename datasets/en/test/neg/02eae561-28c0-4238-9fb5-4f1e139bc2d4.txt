The New Years Eve show said it started at 10 pm, and I found myself still outside at 10:45 waiting to get in.  Once we got in we notice that nobody came to take a drink order or food order from us.  All the tables around us had drinks and food and came in after us.  WTF!!!  The first 2 comics sucked, but we were there to see Kevin Nealon who was funny.  Next, some girl who was clearly under 21 was puking all over the floor next to us.  For the "Ball Drop" there was supposed to be a Champagne toast which AGAIN we NEVER got served!!  The final BS to this night was that they never brought my change from the bill I paid.  They were soooo nice that they gave us free tickets to come back and experience this crap again.  I think NOT!!
