So I stopped in for a quick pre-workout snack.  I ordered a breakfast panini on high five fiber bread...and while the panini was quite tasty and the bread was great...I ran into two...yes two different colored hairs cooked in to the egg whites.  Why does this always happen to me?  The first hair specimen is definitely from a small white dog.  The second hair appears to be of human origin.

Someone hit me back when they get their quality control issues fixed...cause I won't be back until then...if ever.
