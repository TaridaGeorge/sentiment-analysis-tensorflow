I've brought in clothes twice.  The first time things went smoothly.  The second time they didn't put my stuff under my account.  I walked around the store and none of my stuff was there, so obviously sold.  One word of Advice make sure you don't leave the area where you drop off  your clothes until you have a receipt in hand and don't lose that receipt.
