Food was OK but the service was horrible. We went with a group of around 20. It took forever just to get our first drinks and getting a refill was just too much to ask I guess. The worst part was that 1/2 of our table got and finished their food before the second half was served. Literally, down the middle (the long way) because that is how they took the order. Never experienced anything like that. Started at 7:00pm and were there for more than two hours. The night could have been saved with good drink service. Of course since we were a group a 20% gratuity (not %18) was already added to the bill. First and last time eating here.
