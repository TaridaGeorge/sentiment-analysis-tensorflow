I wish I could give negative stars.

I've been with this bank for 20 years, and this means nothing to them. In the 20 years I've been with them they have done endless crap to me like auto-enrolling me in programs I don't want the latest of which caused over $300 in fees on my account. After calling them, they put me on hold for a while to "review my account" (which obviously means to see if I am important enough to them to refund the fees). Apparently I am not. After holding I was told they won't refund them (again these are fees from a program I never signed up for). Insulting. This is what they continue to do to me after being with them for 20 years.

I'm out. I can't take it anymore.
