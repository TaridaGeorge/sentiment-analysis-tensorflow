Horrible!  I had pad thai, not bad.  My friend had Kung Poa.  The vegetables looked like they were from a frozen bag, the chicken was very dry and the sauce was bland.  The menu says the lunch is served with Thai spring roll.  Really?  It looked like a cheap frozen appetizer you'd find at the grocery store...Never going again.
