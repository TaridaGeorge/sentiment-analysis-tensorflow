I've had the tech to my house 4 times, fixing the refrig. Company says they have a warranty. Well, the refrig has NEVER been fixed. They keep coming back to the house, to fix the refrig and no- never done. They mess around and its cost me approaching $700. I had to buy a new refrig, and they are still coming out to 'fix' the refrig. So far they have NOT done anything but caused us grief and cost us money.
