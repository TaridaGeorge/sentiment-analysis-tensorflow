Had the fajitas there.  They were tasteless.  Just some meat on tortillas with absolutely no seasoning.  Plus, the waiter was too busy texting to bring us our check.  We had to go and get it from him.  Never got the coke we ordered either and there were only a couple of people in the restaurant at the time.  Won't go back.
