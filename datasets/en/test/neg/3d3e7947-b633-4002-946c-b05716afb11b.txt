Bend over ! It's the insipid oafs @ the UPS store !
I sent back 1 item to a company earlier in the week. Later in the week I sent back 2 more items to the same co. On the 2nd order they;
 1. initially overcharged me, 
 2. described pedals as "paddles."
 3. used the original R.A.# for the 2nd order, tying the order to a now defunct R.A.#
When I called them up & asked them to cotact the co.( a toll call) they insisted it was all my fault, & they would do NOTHING about it. Furthermore, if the package comes back to me, (waisting 10 days to 2 wks. of my time plus UPS charges), they MAY give me a refund !!!
Bottom line; Think twice or 3 times before using the UPS store @ Osborn & Scottsdale rds. !!!!!
