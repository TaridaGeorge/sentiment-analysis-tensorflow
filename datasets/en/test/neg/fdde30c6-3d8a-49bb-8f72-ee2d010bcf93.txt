When I dropped off my prescriptions and told them I wanted generic on both, I never thought it would be an issue... So when I went in today to get them a found that my more expensive of the two was name brand and WAY expensive, I had the refill & rebill it... Then I got home and realized they'd given me name brand on my birth control as well & the money I'd spent hadn't been for the 3 months I usually pick up but was only for one!!! I know, I should have checked... But what really clinched the 1 star rating was the fact that i got home and looked at it to see that they'd put the wrong doctor's name on my birthcontrol pills (they had my PCP and NOT my gyno who actually prescribed them)... Scary. Not going back.
