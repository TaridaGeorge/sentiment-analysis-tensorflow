NEVER TRY TO GET A PRESCRIPTION FILLED HERE, NEVER! 

Oh my God ... this place is the absolute worst ... it took them THREE MONTHS to change my Dr.'s fax number (they said it had to be done at Headquarters!) ... they regularly gave me double the amount of my 'sript ...  it takes a good 15mins to get a pre called in prescription (EVERY TIME!). They are DRASTICALLY understaffed, rude and incompetent. After a year of shit service, I'm finally done ... no more ... go anywhere but here ... trust me.
