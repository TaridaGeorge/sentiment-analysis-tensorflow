Hopefully, the organizers get their act together and limit the crowd before the competitors run out of food.
We got there around 2:00, got in line and waited about 20 minutes when a staffer comes out with a bullhorn telling everyone that they're not selling anymore tickets until 4 pm because they ran out of food.  
Unfortunately, the organizers didn't anticipate such a turnout.  I was so looking forward to this event since I was in town for spring training.  Anyway, hopefully next year will be better.
