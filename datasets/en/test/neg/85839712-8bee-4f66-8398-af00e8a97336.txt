Be careful when you go to Kona.  My girlfriend and i went on a Saturday afternoon.  The waitress was soooo nice.  Too bad she has to work with horrible people.  After my cousins pycho ex girlfriend (who apperently is a waitress there.) spotted us she had the manager kick us out saying she has a restraining order against me!  Total lie.  I hardly even know this girl except for the horror stories that i have heard.  Whats even worse is the the "manager" actually did it.  Cant comment on the food considering we got kicked out before it came to the table.  Yikes!  hopefully there isnt any imaginary restraining orders on future guests that go in there.
