This review summarizes my initial check-in at the Frontier desk in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport Terminal # 3, where poor customer service appears to be the norm, at least for today. I am already questioning my decision to fly Frontier even BEFORE I step on the plane. I've seen more interactive statues than the people who didn't assist me today. I was treated like an inconvenience rather than a customer.
