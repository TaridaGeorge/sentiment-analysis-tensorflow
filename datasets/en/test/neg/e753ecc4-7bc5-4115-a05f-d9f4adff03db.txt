well, maybe it was the  time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster. I can't understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is.I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about.I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good. I can't say my service was all the great either. I would not go again
