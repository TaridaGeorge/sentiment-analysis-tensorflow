Coming from California where we went to Pancake House all the time we were really excited to find one in the Phoenix area.  Boy were we disappointed!  The food quality is not what I've come to expect from the Pancake House and the service is crap.  The portion sizes are much smaller than we expected (we usually share) also.  The signs on the walls should have warned us away from here "Cash Only" and "Good Food Takes Time."  I have no problem with waiting for good food but that's definitely not what we got.  Plus it's a bit pricey for breakfast.
