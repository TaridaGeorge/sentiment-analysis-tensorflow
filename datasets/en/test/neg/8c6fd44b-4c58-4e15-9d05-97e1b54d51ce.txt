This place has the perfect storm of terribleness. A handful of UofA fans can ruin any bar but this place is particularly bad. In summary: Bad service, Construction fence around the perimeter, smells of broken dreams, a haven for the worst fans (wildcats, michigan and philadelphia eagles? Who knew you could find all of them in the same place!). Pretty sure I saw a kid, age 10-14, playing cornhole out front too.
