This is the most stank trannie bar ever. I went with some friends and it smelled like smelly balls and hooker juice. The karaoke system sucked, rotation was long, there was some crackhead outside smoking talkin bout shankin people and i honestly thought he was gonna shank me. The old bartender that was there which i dont recall but i think he had all of three teeth was rude and the prices werent all that for us to be puttin up with it. Our group sang maybe two songs in the two hours we were there but the worst of the night was when i had to break the seal. The bathroom was covered in diahrea all over the toilets and groung with toilet paper scattered everywhere and when i told the bartender, they left it that way. Can i get a heell nah. Skip this bar
