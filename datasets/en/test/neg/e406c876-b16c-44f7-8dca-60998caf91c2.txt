Staff was friendly and it was busy, but they were definitely limited in their selection. I have never been to a Buffalo Exchange with such a little selection and what there was available was just meh, I've seen better. The clothes to pick from were very generic, there was nothing that screamed out to me high quality! or wow, what a cute outfit. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon, I was very disappointed.
