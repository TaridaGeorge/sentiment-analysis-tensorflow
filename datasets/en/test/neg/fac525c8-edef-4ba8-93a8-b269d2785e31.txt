If you're not Caucasian don't anticipate getting service, but do anticipate getting dirty looks by the employees, and other Caucasian shoppers.  Someone should tell the associates', and the overall company that people of color's money is just as good as Caucasian's. Perhaps this store would benefit from "Sensitivity & Diversity" traning.  It is so rude to not welcome EVERYONE to your store, and to not treat all those who enter your store with the same level of respect, and willingness to assist as the last regardless of their skin color. I'll spend my hard earned money else where thank you.
