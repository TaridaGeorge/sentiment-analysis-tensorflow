ahh well once again this is a place I go becasue others I am with suggest we go. Not once has anyone I have ever been with has ever had a good meal. This of course includes me. A lot of money for beyond bland. I will speak up if anyone ever trys to convince me to go again. I would rather Jack in the Box down the street. At least I can get yucky food for three dollars there.
