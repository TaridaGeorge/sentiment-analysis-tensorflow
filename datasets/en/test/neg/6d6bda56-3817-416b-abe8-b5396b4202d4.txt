I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE gave even two stars to THIS PLACE!!!  I got a manicure there....hooooooorrrible....the job was so unprofessional it looked like I did it myself.  I thought I'd still give them a chance because  I believe in second chances, so I went to get a pedicure there the other day.  Again, horrible!  I don't care that the nail tech spent countless minutes on the massage- I wanted my final results to LOOK good.  Both of the times I went my cuticles were horribly cut, the filing was hardly done, and the nail polish was sloppy!  My big toe has an extra layer of polish that dried so funny it looks gross.  I am so disappointed in this place....and moreover,  nail shops in Tempe are very hard to find!  I wish I could find one that was good :-(.
