Unfortunately this location is close to my house and the worst location for a pharmacy. The wait time is too long for dropping off. They hardly ever have what I need.  I haven't been back in 8 years. I will gladly drive out of my way to 70 th and Shea to get my scripts which are always prompt at that location.
