This Starbucks is SLIPPING.......twice within 1 week we have left empty handed. Stopped in for coffee a couple nights ago and the girl said, "we don't have any". I thought she was joking...finally she said "if you want to wait we can make some." frustrated by the lazy-faire attitude we left. Sunday afternoon @ 1:30 we stopped in for a pound of espresso beans (which we buy once a week at this same location) only to be told, "we're out....we don't have any!" UNBELIEVABLE!!! Are you a coffee store or just a wi fi hot spot? Needless to say this is disturbing & what makes it worse is the staff doesn't care in the slightest!!
