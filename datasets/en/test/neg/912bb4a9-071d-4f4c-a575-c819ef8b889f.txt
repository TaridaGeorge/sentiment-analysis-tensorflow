This is a third rate office driven by greed and incompetence. They only have their own interest in mind, not yours. Especially avoid glass. That hack talked me into wearing braces. Three years and thousands of dollars later I have crooked, misaligned teeth and I live in constant pain from TMJ caused by bruxism caused by malocclusion caused by the moron. After the braces came off, my teeth were so misaligned that that ignorant peasant started grinding them down. As a result one of them was grinded down to almost half its size. That thief also overcharged me for some regular extractions (considering them as surgical). Look at his picture! While my diet consists of Aleve and Tylenol, that greedy pig is getting fatter and fatter.
