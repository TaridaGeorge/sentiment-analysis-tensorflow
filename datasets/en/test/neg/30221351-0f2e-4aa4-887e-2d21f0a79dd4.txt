My mothers retirement home had a reservation for 30 people at Chompies  tomorrow.  The community called to confirm today and Chompies said they didn't see the reservation and they were to busy with TV stations coming to accommodate them.  The community even had the persons name that took the reservation.  There is a big promotion on tomorrow which they didn't even offer to provide them for a different date.  There are a lot of upset seniors. It's very sad, something they were all looking forward to!!
