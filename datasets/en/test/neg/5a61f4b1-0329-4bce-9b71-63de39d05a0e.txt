I have been going to Ticoz for years and loved it! BUT... last week i went with friends and the place was empty... i wondered why... then the waiter came to our table... he was rude to my friend right off the bat... unbelievable! she was nice enough and laughed it off... it left a bad taste in my mouth. the prices have risen and the food quality had declined. i ordered the nachos for us and they were horrific. the peach salad was still good though... Ticoz.... seriously right now? lower your freakin prices, quit charging for salsa and chips... hire nicer staff... or your days are numbered... just sayin"
