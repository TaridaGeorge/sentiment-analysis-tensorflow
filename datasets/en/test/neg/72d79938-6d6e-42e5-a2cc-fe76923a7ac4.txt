Went to the GAP event on Sunday and was extremely disappointed. Most of the restaurants were chains or mediocre places that weren't offering any good food. The lines were out of control and the place was so packed with people I was constantly getting bumped and having to dodge strollers and rampant kids. Even though it was only $10 to get in, the prices for food and drink were so high that we ended up spending way more than we would have if we had just gone barhopping in downtown Scottsdale... which is what we ended up doing when we left.  Ironically the best food I had there was from Los Taquitos, which isn't even in Scottsdale, it's in Ahwatukee.

Save your money.  Its not worth what you pay.
