Eek is right...not sure what all of the rave reviews are about?! 
Saturday afternoon lunch...none of the employees looked happy to be there. No real greeting, took a long time to be seated, and then the service was horrendous! A solid 10 minutes of sitting, another 10 minutes to get drinks, and then all the food was on the table before we had silverware. 
During the meal, we had 4 or 5 different waitresses, people bringing random things at different times, and orders had to be verified 3 times. I ordered the southwest chicken salad, which came with a mini quesadilla. Somehow, I was the last one to be served. 
Some things looked/smelled good, but the salad was a little limp, the fruit was slimy, and there were no refills. 
On a happy note, prices are decent/cheap.
