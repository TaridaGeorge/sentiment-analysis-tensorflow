The breakfast food served when I ordered the scrambled eggs combo was probably scooped out of a buffet style bin dropped here several hours (or even the day before) earlier.  The eggs were cool, toast wouldn't melt the butter, bacon was tough and room temperature.   However, credit to my waitress for removing it and serving me (by request) a fresh fruit cup.  Really lousy food at high prices.
