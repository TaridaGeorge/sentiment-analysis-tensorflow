Had some stuff stolen out of my luggage my the maid and had to have the police come out. Staff were not overly concerned, nor did they show a sense of urgency. 3 days later and still no call or email from mgmt to apologize or tell me that my things were recovered-the police did call to say my things were found hidden in the laundry room along with other guests' possessions. Probably have to head back to AZ from CA to get my stuff because it's been booked in as evidence, but who knows when. This is the short version, believe me, but needless to say I will never patronize this chain again.
