We had mother's day brunch and overall this place was a fail.  The buffet was $16.95/person + tax + 18% gratuity.  Over priced!!!  My water glass was refilled only once, our dirty plates weren't taken until we asked, our silver wasn't replaced and the buffet selection was unimpressive. No omelet bar or anything beyond basic buffet.
