Will never go back! The service was awful & the sandwiches are sloppy, ugly, poor quality messes. Only 1 vegetarian option, old/soggy toppings. Told the counter girl I had not been there before.  She gave no useful information. Told her I am a vegetarian. She made some condescending remark (possible joke but not funny.) Told her TWICE what I did not want on the sandwich, the cook in the window heard me & they still got it wrong. DO NOT go there.
