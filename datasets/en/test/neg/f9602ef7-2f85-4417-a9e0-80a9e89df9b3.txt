Responded to a promotion of theirs that excluded "holidays".  This was Dec. 24 which is the day BEFORE a holiday, yet they refused to honor the promotion on the basis that Dec. 24 is a holiday.  Had to wait for a table even though there seemed to be plenty available.  Service was slow and the food was mediocre plus they forgot my side dish.  Very disappointing because we had heard such good things about this place.
