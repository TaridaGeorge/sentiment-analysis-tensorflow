My two young boys received the worst haircuts they have ever received by separate hairstylists (if that's what you call them).  They both are trying to let their hair grow out a little longer.  Both look like they have mullets.  Terrible...will never go back!  I could have done a better job.  The old saying, you get what you paid for is certainly true in this situation.
