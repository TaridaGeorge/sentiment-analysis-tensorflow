SLOPPY WORK.  I thought I had a leak after they changed the oil, but it was just oil underneath the filter that they chose not to clean.  I am guessing they probably figured nobody would notice if there was a little oil on the bottom, but there was enough to leak all over my driveway.  Take your business to some place that takes pride in their work. NOT HERE!!
