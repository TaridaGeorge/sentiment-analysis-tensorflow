I've spent well over $ 5,000 to try and get an issue with my brakes lights fixed, and after 3 visits and many thousands of dollars later they couldn't figure out the issue. Since then I've done more research and I found out there there's Technical Service Bulletin (TSBs) for the exact issue that I've been having, and so I had thousands of dollars of service that wasn't needed, and that didn't address the root cause. The service department is incompetent or they are just trying to take advantage of their customers. Either way I would strongly recommend avoiding this place, especially their service department.
