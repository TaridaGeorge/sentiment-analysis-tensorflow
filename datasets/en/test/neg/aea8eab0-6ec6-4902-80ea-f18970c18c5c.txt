The last time I stopped in At HoT was with clients for a lunch. Absolute DISASTER. We got our lunchtime libations and ordered. And waited. And waited. And waited. No drink refills. And it was late May so we could have used them. 

Finally, our waiter comes over with a light appetizer plate and apologizes that our order wasn't placed properly. Some lame excuse and then... he said he paid for the appetizer out of his own pocket since he didn't want the manager to ream him. 

By the time we got our food, it was an hour-and-a-half from when we walked in. Not good in my book. Needless to say, I haven't been back. At least my clients had a good sense of humor and said I pulled a good Trick on them.
