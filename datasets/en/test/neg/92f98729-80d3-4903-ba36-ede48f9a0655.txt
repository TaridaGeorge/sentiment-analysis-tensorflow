Don't go here for the food or service. Food is outrageously expensive, small portions, no seasoning. You don't have to actually eat in the restaurant to see all the attractions. If you have kids, take them here, walk them around and then leave and go eat somewhere else. $68 for 2 adults and 2 kids (no drinks or dessert and one less expensive kids meal) is crazy.  My fish tacos had one tiny piece of fish and tons of cabbage.  Bland, bland, bland.  Will never eat here again.
