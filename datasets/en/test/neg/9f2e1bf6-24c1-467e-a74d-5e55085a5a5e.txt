A friend and I went here for lunch today. We received a lukewarm (I'll be with you guys in a minute) greeting from a server. Same server took us to our table, piss poor attitude. Our actual server provided the same lukewarm greeting. Note to restaurants: TRAIN your servers to not address guests as "You Guys," especially when one of the guests is a lady. We ordered a pizza with tomatoes, mushrooms and sausage (sausage only on half). They messed up our first pizza and brought us out another. This restaurant is nothing like the namesake in Brooklyn. Decent food, bad service. I will not be going back here or any other Grimaldi's except the original in Brooklyn.
