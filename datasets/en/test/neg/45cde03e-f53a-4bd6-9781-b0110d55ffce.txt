I live right next door to the PV Chompies and I would order from them all the time if not for the fact that their staff is totally incompetent and rude.  They can't put together a take-out order to save their lives.  Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else.  There are tons of MUCH better places nearby that have great food and great service.
