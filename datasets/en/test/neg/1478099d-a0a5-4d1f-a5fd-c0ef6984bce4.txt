If I could give negative stars I would. This place sucks. We have eaten here a few times and the service has always been subpar, but this trip takes the cake. We left after 15 minutes standing in line while the only two employees on the floor were making passes at the Pepsi vendor working on the soda fountain. We will not be back to this location, I would rather make the trip to Gilbert were their food is actually fresh and the service isn't terrible.
