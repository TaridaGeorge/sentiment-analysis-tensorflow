So very disappointing!  From the Edamame to the Spicy Tuna Roll! We went for Happy Hour and ordered 5 different orders of sushi, edamame, gyoza, calamari tempura & seaweed salad, every single item tasted the same with the exception of the seaweek salad, that was so overpowering with dressing that it was inedible. Can you believe no pomegrante martini? Seriously? Place was empty which should have told us something. Couldn't find the entrance, front door blends right into the building, seriously! Had to cut through an opening in the gate to try and get into the restaurant, which was pretty much what was happening with everyone else that tried to get in...Just ridiculous.  Bye bye Stingray, will be heading back across the street to Ra where sushi is superb!
