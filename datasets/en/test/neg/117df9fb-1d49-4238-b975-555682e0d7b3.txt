After leaving a previous poor review, I was consistently contacted by upper management trying to redeem themselves. This restaurant is not near my home but I agreed to try them again and was promised they would send a certificate for dinner on them at our convenience.  However, it has been over a month now and I have yet to see anything. I am still VERY unsatisfied with this company.
