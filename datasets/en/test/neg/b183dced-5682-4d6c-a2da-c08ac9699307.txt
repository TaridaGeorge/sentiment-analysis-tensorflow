The buzz of the microwave, the rude service, the pretentious cash only policy at a restaurant with 15.00 entrees, lots of syscofood product cans in eye view, The food here realy sucks, but if your lucky enough to get a kitchen view, all you will hear is the hum and dings of the microwave... The manager/server wen I asked him what he reccomended.. he got quite coindescending with me.."Never ask that question, they wil just push what is getting old"  what a complete douschbag.. I dined here 3 months ago.. saw this review, and had to speak my peace...
