Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws:

1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.

To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!!


2.  The "collection" here is 90% DVDs and "Dummies" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure.
