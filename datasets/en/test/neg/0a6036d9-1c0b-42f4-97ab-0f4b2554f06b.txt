No, no, no. Half Chinese food, half burger joint with Mexican food? Cash only? Greasy feeling just from walking in? Tried this place because I kept hearing good things, but it was a total let down. There was an accidental piece of orange chicken in my bag of French fries...burger wasn't memorable, but I remember not really thinking that the vegetables were....vegetables. Quite gross.
