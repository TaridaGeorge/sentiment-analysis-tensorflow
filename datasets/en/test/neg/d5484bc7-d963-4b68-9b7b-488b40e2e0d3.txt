First time ever I have taken the time to write a review. The owner ( wife), is extremely rude!  We spend a good 10 to 15 thousand dollars a year there for many years. They ruined many items of clothes(which would never take responsibility for!) but this last time was a dress that I just bought. She waited so long to tell me that now I cannot replace it because it is sold out! She said she would eat half and I would have to eat half and basically threw it at me with a look of disgust!!! 
They delivered my clothes the next day and charged my card...so she didn't even eat the half that was promised.
Do Not Do Buisness with these people!!!!!!!!!!
