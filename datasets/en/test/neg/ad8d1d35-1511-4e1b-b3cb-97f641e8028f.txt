update: i ended up calling aamco customer service to report the nincompoopery on behalf of the scottsdale store.  after 3 replacements, my water pump seems to be functioning correctly.  although i did ask the manager to have the mechanics clean off all of the residual coolant, they didn't.  jackasses.  and my power steering pump seems to be alright; however, this does not change my rating.  aamco is a complete SHAM.  do NOT take your car here even for an oil change.  i TRUELY believe that aamco mechanics have no idea what they're doing and probably fuck other things up in your engine so that you have to bring it back.
