I read the reviews and tried this spot instead of using AZ Foot Spa across the street by Frys. I always liked AZ, but this place sounded just as good.
The massage was TERRIBLE. I tried to explain to the woman giving the massage to use some pressure, even showing her how to do the massage, but she spoke no English and just smiled and laughed. I almost ended it several times but did not know how I could leave the place without paying the fee anyhow. I let her continue her, paid the fee and went right across the street to AZ where I got a fantastic 90 minute for 45.00
