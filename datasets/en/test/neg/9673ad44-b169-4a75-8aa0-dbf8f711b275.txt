My fiance and I are a HUGE fan of sushi... I'd say addicted.  After reading so many of the good reviews, we decided to give it a try... well, YUCK is all we have to say! The sushi was overpriced, the cold rolls came out warm, while the one "cooked, warm" roll that came out tasted like it was covered in barely-warmed mayonnaise. GROSS. I actually cried having to pay the expensive bill for the disgusting food we received here. Would never eat here again if it was the last sushi place on earth!
