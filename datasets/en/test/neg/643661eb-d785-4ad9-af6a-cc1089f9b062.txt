Bad service.
Noisy.
Plane is not maintained clean.

They do not prep the plane well mechanically thus our flight broke down in Tokyo.
Wonderful.
We all had to be bussed to the middle of nowhere in Japan where all forms of communication were severed w/ our families.
(we passnegers had no local currency)
