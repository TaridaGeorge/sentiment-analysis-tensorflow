I understand that with fast food you can't be terribly picky, however, tonight they completely dropped the ball. 

I ordered 2 fish filet meals, large. I received 2 medium drinks and some cheeseburgers. Ok, you'd think it's a simple mix up... No. I had to argue with 2 employees to get my order right. I left somewhat upset only to be even sooner angry. I was 1/4 of the way through my fish filet when I found a black piece of plastic... Safety hazard, I'm sure. 

I really enjoy McDonald's from time to time, but unfortunately they were unable to keep up their end of the deal - "great" fast food and service.
