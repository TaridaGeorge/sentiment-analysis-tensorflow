Great food & great service when ordering as always :-)

Now ask to use the restroom after 12midnight & their A+ customer service does a 180 & goes to down right rude.  I was honestly surprised at how disrespectful their staff was when I asked why their restrooms were closed & when I inquired more about the policy 3 staff members were so down right rude I simply walked out.

This location needs a serious attitude adjustment, which is too bad cause the food itself is great!
