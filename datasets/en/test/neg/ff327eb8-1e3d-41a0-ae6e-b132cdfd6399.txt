The place is aweful. We were taken to a table with food on the chair, on the floor around and the table is so dirty that you hands would stick to it. We went there for DimSum. It is the worst Dimsum in PHX. They had very little choices to start with and the food was COLD! People work there seemed unhappy for some reason. The management people are dressed fancier than other places, but they sure make you feel they don't want you to be there with their poker faces. We will never go back again.
