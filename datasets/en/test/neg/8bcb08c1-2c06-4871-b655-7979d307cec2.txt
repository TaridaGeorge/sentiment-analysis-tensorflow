A retarded friend of mine who must have been smoking crack dragged me here against my will the other day, for lunch. We were headed for a perfectly nice 5-star lunch at Prime, but he saw this place on the way and got into his head the notion that a shitty, unclean interior with apathetic if not rude waitress service and mediocre food was what we needed instead of the spotless interior, eager-to-please service and delicious food waiting for us at Prime. Not shockingly, we had a perfectly mediocre time at lunch and I left feeling completely unsatisfied. And like I really needed to wash my hands and/or take a shower. Blech.
