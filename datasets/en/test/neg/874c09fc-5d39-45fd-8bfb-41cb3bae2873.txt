This is the most overpriced food in Tempe.  It has a great spot on mill and you can watch everyone go by, but too bad you couldn't do that and not buy anything.  If you want to sit on this block, you might as well go to hooters across the way.  At least you could save some money and eat the same quality food.  There are many good places to eat on Mill, so skip this one.
