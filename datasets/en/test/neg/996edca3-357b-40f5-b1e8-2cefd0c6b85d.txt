Bad ambiance, worse service staff, terrible sushi. We moved to T town & tried this place based off our experiences in Tempe & downtown Phoenix. This wasn't the same. Ichi Ban in Tempe & Phx were a quick decent lunch time sushi place. So our expectations were already mediocre expecting a lunch experience for dinner. What we got was nothing short of pathetic. Go to Ah-So in Good Year if you live on the West side this is the BEST sushi West of Central don't waste your precisous time or money at Ichi Ban Tolleson.
