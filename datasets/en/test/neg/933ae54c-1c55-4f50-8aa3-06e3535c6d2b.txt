Simply not acceptable. I drove through last night and the kid working the drive thru was too busy "rapping" about his "hustle" to a.) get my order right, and b.) give me my change. The Frosty I ordered was completely melted and might as well have been a lukewarm chocolate milk. This is quite possibly the worst Wendy's location in the area, the service here is consistently awful.
