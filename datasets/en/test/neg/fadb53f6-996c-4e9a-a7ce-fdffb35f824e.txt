I was excited about trying Dunkin' Donuts for the first time during my AZ stay. 

That is, until I brought an iced coffee and a dozen home for my family, and there was a spider on one of the glazed donuts. Not just chillin' there on it, but actually GLAZED ONTO it. A poor, defenseless spider frozen in time by sugary, sticky icing. 

I told this particular Dunkin' Donuts, and they said they were sorry. That's it. They were sorry and they were going to pull those glazed donuts off the shelves for the rest of the day. 

I didn't even like donuts that much to begin with, but I'll probably never eat one again. 

Wow. Thank you so much, DD!
