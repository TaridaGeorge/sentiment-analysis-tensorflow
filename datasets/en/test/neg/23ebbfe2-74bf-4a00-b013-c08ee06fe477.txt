Well, compared to everyone else, I got a great person at the window, she was not only kind and sweet, but she made terrific conversation, never met anyone as nice. However, the hot chocolate was terrible, i mean, bitter, burnt, gross, and completely un-drinkable. How can you mess up hot chocolate? You have to TRY to get that wrong. More over, i asked for without whipped cream and got some anyways, I hate that. There was a particular reason i asked for without, I wouldn't go out  of my without reason. 

Also, this is mainly a get your coffee and go type place, only outdoor seating next to a large intersection. Not recommended for a relaxing place. And my experience doesn't mean all the Batistas are as nice as this one individual. 

Seriously, don't bother with this place though, the one on Mill is far better.
