Like an evil health insurance company, U.S. Airways is always looking for new ways to rob its customers with fees. I'll never forget how U.S. Airways refused to give me a cup of potable water on a flight when I had bronchitis because I didn't have cash to buy a bottle. This airline is America's worst!
