Epic fail for this place. 

I was just out wandering around thinking about what to make for New Years Eve Dinner.  So I thought I would pick up a pound of their signature ham.

To my dismay, once I brought it home in the sealed non-see thru packaging, it had no authentic glaze on it whatsoever.  And if you know ham, then you know that ham aint ham unless you have it glazed.

So it was extremely dissapointing to say the least, I will be calling the manager back to see what they have to say and if they make good on the mistake.
