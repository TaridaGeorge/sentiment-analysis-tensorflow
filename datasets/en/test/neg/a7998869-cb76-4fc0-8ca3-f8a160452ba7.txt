I went in because I knew I needed work done. They gave me an estimate for $7k and told me my out of pocket would be almost $3k. Confused by this, I called my insurance company 4 days ago. The agent told me Aspen screwed up and used the wrong insurance code and I would have to call in and get a new one. I called Aspen, and "Candy" (a false name to protect the wicked) - a most unpleasant and rude woman - snapped at me and said they would call me... they still have not. I assume this is not uncommon.
