I can hardly believe how highly rated this restaurant/wine bar is. I have been twice and both times was treated to high prices, poor and condescending service and mediocre food.

Once I ordered a veggie plate specifically because the menu stated that it included haricot verts. When the plate came they were not on it. I questioned the server and she said they were "out of season", but had not bothered to tell me in advance that the menu item would not be as described. 

Against my better judgment I went back a second time with a wine tasting group. Some political thing was to take place in the restaurant hours later. It was being set up for so we were shunted to some tables we didn't want, service was abysmal and the food and wine were really overpriced for what we received. 

I will never go back.
