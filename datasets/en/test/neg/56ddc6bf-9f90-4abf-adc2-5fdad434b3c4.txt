Ate here today as my kids wanted pizza for lunch and they sold it by the slice. Ordered 2 slices of pep, 1 sausage, a house salad, 3 drinks. $20. Out of Italian dressing so I req. oil and vinegar. 

we sat outside and they brought the pizza out. They brought two slices on 1 paper plate and only 1 or 2 forks even though there were 3 of us. So i sent the lady back inside for more utensils, another plate, and napkins. The pizza was dry and tasted like it had been nuked. The salad was plain and almost ALL oil...where was the vinegar? Salad nothing but iceberg lettuce, olives, onions, and tomatoes and only oil for dressing. 

VERY disappointed at crappy service and crappy pizza. Lots of great bars and stuff to do in that area so skip this place.
