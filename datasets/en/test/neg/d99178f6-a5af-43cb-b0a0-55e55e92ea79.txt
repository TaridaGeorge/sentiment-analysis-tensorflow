The WORST "service" I have EVER had in my LIFE. I arrived at 5:15pm and was seated at the bar. We received our drinks, menus, napkins with silverware at 5:30pm. We were not spoken to until 10:15pm. Yes, that was 4 hours and 45 minutes later ! We were totally ignored for 4 hours and 45 minutes with our watered down drinks, menus, and rolled up silverware in napkins sitting on the bar in front of us. Not a word was spoken to us by ANY employee during the 4 hours and 45 minutes. The only reason I would ever return would be to give them a bill for the time I wasted there. Obviously, SERVICE is NOT the reason this establishment is still in business.
