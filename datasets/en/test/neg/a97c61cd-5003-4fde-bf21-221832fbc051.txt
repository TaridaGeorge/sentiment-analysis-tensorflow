Probably the worst Asian buffet I've ever been to. You walk in and you can get a sense of the dinge. The table I was seated at had two ripped leather seats with foam spilling out. Sure, Asian buffets can be of questionable quality, but this took questionability (is that a word?) to new extremes.

The food? Let's just say oilier than Jermaine Jackson. The chicken and beef made my stomach spin into a giant vortex of bleh - you really got the sense that their shelf lives were long gone. I left half my plate there and walked out - no longer hungry even though I was starving when I walked in.

I'm not biased against Asian buffets. Just this one.

My poor stomach. All abused.
