I am not one to typically complain, but I feel that Top of the Line Perfume (a store In this "outlet" mall) is a joke. They inflate their prices astronomically and then tell the consumer that they will give a 50% discount.  The perfume I purchased was $50, marked down from $89. I found it for $20 on Amazon. I called to speak with a manager to no avail. Naomi, an absurdly rude sales associate, would not transfer me to a manager. Please save your money!
