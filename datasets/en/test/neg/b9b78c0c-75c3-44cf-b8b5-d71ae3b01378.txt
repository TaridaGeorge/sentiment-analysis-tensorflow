This was the strangest coffee experience I have ever had in my life.  I drink black coffee every morning and enjoy a great cup of coffee that isnt starbucks .  The attitude of the baristas was beyond strange.  They have this attitude that you have to drink the coffee the way that they want you to drink it. They do not believe in sugars or normal coffee bar  necessities.   The coffee was ok a lil bland not great. If you know coffee and enjoy a good cup with out fuss or being insulted I would go elsewhere. This coffee house made me yearn for starbucks which i never ever would imagine saying.
