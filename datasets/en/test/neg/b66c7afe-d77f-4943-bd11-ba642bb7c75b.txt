Noisy!!  Poorly sound proofed rooms means that every car with booming stereos outside you have to listen to!  I have never had this noisy of a hotel room.  Even worse, some family upstairs appeared to be practicing tap dancing based on the racket they were making.  

No wi fi in the rooms, you have to use wired Internet access.

Having the Arizona Mills shopping center across the street was handy for xmas shopping.  

The free breakfast was good.
