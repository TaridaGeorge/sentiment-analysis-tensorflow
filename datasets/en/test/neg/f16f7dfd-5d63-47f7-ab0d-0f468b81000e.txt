unfortunately I didnt like it. The breading covering the fish was like bird food. The fries was like any other fries out there. The service was bad. It was my first time there and I forgot to tell them I want the cod because I read in yelp that was the best. I guess the default was the catfish. It took a long time for the food to be ready. The only reason I gave it 1 stars was because the shrimp was not bad. I wish the breading for the shrimp was used for the fish I think that would have made a big difference. So this is a place I will not go again! Petes fish and chips all the way for me!!!!!
