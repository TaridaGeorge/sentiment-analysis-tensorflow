At the risk of sounding like a snob, I was pretty annoyed with the ostentatious "exotic" atmosphere of the place. 

While I would never personally consider eating here, being Asian and spoiled with Asian food while growing up in San Francisco, I am totally biased. Pei Wei's food is edible, just nothing compared to the Asian cuisine you can get elsewhere (even in Chandler) that is tastier and less expensive. 

For what this is, I would rather go to Panda Express.
