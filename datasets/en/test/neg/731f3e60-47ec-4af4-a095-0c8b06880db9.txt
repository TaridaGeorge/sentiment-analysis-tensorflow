I could not be more dissappointed in this restaurant.  Service was horrible.  We ordered two slices of cheese pizza (that was already cooked) and a small ceasar salad.  We waited for 10 minutes, and finally 1 slice came to us and it cold.  After an additional 10 mintues I went to the counter to ask where the rest of the order was, there were no apologies I was just told that it would be right out.  Seriously, 10 minutes later I had to go to the counter again, and still it was another 5 before my salad and piece of cheese pizza were brought to the table.  I will definately not be back.
