This place keeps getting more and more ghetto! I will not, repeat will NOT visit this store after dark by myself. Hire a security officer already! 

Not only does the clientele leave something to be desired, the selection is awful! I will drive to Safeway on 7th St and Glendale (at least 8 more minutes away from my house) just to not have to visit this store. It's a shame that the closest large grocer to my home is so horrible. 15th Ave and Northern is a really nice area, yet the closest super market is awful. I just don't get it?!
