this is by far the worst burger king i have ever been to. the first mistake was when i ordered the brownie icecream and the girl who made it gave it to me burnt. when asked did she know the brownies were burned she said yes and gave them to us to eat anyways. then when i go to the drive thru to make two seperate orders i was told only one order per vehicle allowed. i was like since when is this and why is that. the employees are so lazy and half assed they never do anything right. i would say if you are hungry and need a quick bite to eat do not come here what so ever. it should be closed down and they need to do a massive rehire.
