The lady with a tattoo on her neck seemed like she's in a rush did my full set in 30 mins wayyy to fast.She made my nails all different lengths and very crooked and not filed straight. She didnt clean up my cuticles and the clear coat had Soooo many air bubbles. I have never been so upset with my nails after they were done NEVER EVER would I come back to pro nails spa EVER AGAIN!!!!!
