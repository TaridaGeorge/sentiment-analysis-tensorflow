We decided to try this place for the first time today. First impression was great - the place looked real nice. 

Service was horrible! We waited for our drinks, we waited to order, we waited for our food, we waited for drink refills. We waited from entrance to food served - almost 40 minutes! My order wasn't complete, I had to ask for my toast. Someone else at our table also just got up and asked for refills. 

The food itself was okay. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. I thought my omelet had a bit too much cheese and the potatoes seemed almost tasteless. For the cost, I felt cheated.

Honestly, I will NOT go here again.
