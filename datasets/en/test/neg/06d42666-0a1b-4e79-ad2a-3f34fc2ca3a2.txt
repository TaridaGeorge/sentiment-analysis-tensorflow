Was in Phoenix from Toronto for business conference. Drove about 25 minutes to get this burger based on reviews on Yelp. Got a Double Afterburner and a Single Chilli burger with onion rings. The guy at the counter, who I think is one of the owner's, was VERY nice and polite. If you are a fan of soda, they have a HUGE selection of about 300 different sodas to choose from. I grabbed a 4-pack of Jones Blue Cream Soda for about $7.50 (!).

NASTY!

The onion rings were coated in a VERY thin layer of disgusting batter. it was of a dark brown colour and not very good at all. Both of my burgers (I love food) had soggy buns and were not very good at all. I don't recommend this place at all. I would rather eat at In & Out.
