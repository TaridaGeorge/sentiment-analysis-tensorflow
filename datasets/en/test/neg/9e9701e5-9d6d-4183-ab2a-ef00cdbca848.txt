If you like an arrogant waitress you are in luck! If you do not have a reservation be prepared to sit in the sun (where today, 12/29, you smell gas from the construction next door) or in the yellow room (if there is anyone beside your table, you can't hear each other). The food was fairly good, but if you are not really hungrey and just want a small soup or salad, no choices. For the money, not worth it. Especially have a waitress that completely made me feel like a second class citizen.
