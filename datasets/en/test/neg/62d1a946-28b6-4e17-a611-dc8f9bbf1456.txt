First Impressions Count
I've been here an hour waiting for my movie that was sold out (that happens I guess) but it's given me ample time to observe the customer service philosophy. There is none.
 I know. "theyve only been open a month.."  well they need to lock it down or lock it up.  
Im at the bar, one of twenty customers, but i have not seen an employee for five minutes!  Every employee seemed frazzled, or too busy to help. The managers only made it worse, distracting them and demonstrating how to ignore a customer. 
We had a pitcher of watery beer and chips and salsa. $20 plus a "gratuity suggestion" pre printed on the tab. 

Im thinking about cutting my losses and skipping the movie.... What do u think?
