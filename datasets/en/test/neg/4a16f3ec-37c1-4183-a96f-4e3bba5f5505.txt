Wish I could give ZERO stars. The Argentine I got had next to nothing on it. Instead of veganaise the bread was covered in some green grease. Looked awful. Couldn't eat it. My side of thyme fries consisted of 12 soggy fries. I paid $10 for this? I'll never get food to go from Green, ever again. 

Hope you take this into consideration before eating or paying for the slop they're serving.
