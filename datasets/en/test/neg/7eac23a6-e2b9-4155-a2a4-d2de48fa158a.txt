Got take out tonight. Wow this place is the worst Chinese food I have ever had! Ordered Vegetable Crispy Chow Mien which turned out to be a box of spouts and celery with a handful of Crispy Noodles from a can. Also asked for extra spicy Orange Chicken which was very runny and all breading. I think the only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and stale fortune cookie. I don't recommend this place to anyone. (I don't like Panda Express either, so don't think I am that type of food person.)

BTW... My fortune cookie taught me "ce sou" which is Chinese for RESTROOM and is where I will be after trying this place.
