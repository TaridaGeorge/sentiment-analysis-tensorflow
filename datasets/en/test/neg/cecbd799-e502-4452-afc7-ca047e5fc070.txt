I recently moved to Scottsdale and decided to check out the mall. Stores were ok, but the food court was appalling with middle school, high school students yelling profanities and speaking abnormally loud. It was very uncomfortable and don't understand why mall management would let kids behave in that manner. It was culture shock. Worse than any mall I have ever visited. MALL MANAGEMENT - CONTROL THOSE ANIMALS!!!!!
