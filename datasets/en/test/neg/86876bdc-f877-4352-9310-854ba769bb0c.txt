Went there last Friday night around 9:30 as I was staying in a local hotel and a Sports Bar close by seemed a no brainer. Boy was I wrong

Positive first; 
really good service by our waitress, 
lots of TVs 
OK atmosphere.

The negative; 
Only 4 beers on tap in a Sports Bar (are you nuts)
The food was horrible and overpriced. How do you mess up nachos? The worst I have ever had; left most there. Tasteless burgers, Calamari chew toys, and so it went. The only thing edible was the fries.
 
Too bad, because this place has real potential, but crappy overpriced food and an extremely limited draft selection overrides atmosphere and service.
