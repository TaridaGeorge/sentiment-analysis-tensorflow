I used to love this place!!  I used to go just about every week faithfully.  One day, I decided to be brave and try their clams.  They were good, but there was a piece of shell hiding underneath the clam and I bit into it!  That really upset me, and hurt my mouth, so I told my server what happened.  She brought a manager over, and all she said was,"Sorry, that's never happened before."  Then kind of shrugged it off.  They should have a sign to warn people that pieces of shells might be floating in there, and I shouldn't have had to pay for my meal when the shell completely ruined my apetite.  I have never gone back since; I am deeply disappointed.
