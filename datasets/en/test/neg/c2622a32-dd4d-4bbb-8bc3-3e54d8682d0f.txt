I was really excited to start classes at CGCC, but the staff completely turned me off to the school. They are beyond unhelpful! They gave me the run around for weeks. Denied me financial aid, even though FAFSA approved me for 2 grants. It's been a complete nightmare trying to get enrolled and set up for school... I will definitely be going elsewhere. They are NOT friendly, or helpful. I can't say enough negative things about CGCC. I'm not a fan.
