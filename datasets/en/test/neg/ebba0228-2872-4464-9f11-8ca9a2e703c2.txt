There's some sort of cupcake craze going on in the valley which I don't understand. What can I say about LuLu's? This place isn't really worth me writing about it, it's crap.

I spent $4 on a cupcake that was small, dry, and had some crappy whipped frosting piled on. I have this good idea to make their cupcakes actually edible: 'Betty Crocker'.
