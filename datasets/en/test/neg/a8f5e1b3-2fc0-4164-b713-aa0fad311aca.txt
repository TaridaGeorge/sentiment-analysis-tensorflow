Crowded, disorganized and overpriced.

The tea selection is ok, but mostly "fashion" teas. 2 ounces of basic Orange Roiboos set me back $16!

No organized lines for drinks or just loose tea. Way too small of a space for as much stuff as they crammed in there. And as there is only one portal, people on their way out have to fight people on their way in!

I'll be going elsewhere for my tea supplies.
