Death glares and no ability to get more chips is what you can expect from this place. The hostess did not respond when we walked in and when we we finally got her attention, she seemed like she didn't even want us there. But we stuck out the ruff start, downhill from there! The angry semi psychopathic bus boy seemed like every time we asked for more chips, a were going to get it with spit in it. The food was alright, but not worth dealing with the angry workers to get! If you choose to go here, go with less than 5 people (they don't have tables bigger than that) and expect death looks from the bus boy... if you make it through that alive and happy to the food, you deserve a giant cookie and the semi authentic Mexican food! 
Good luck and hope for the best!
