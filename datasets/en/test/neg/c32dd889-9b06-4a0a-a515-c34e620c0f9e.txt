I've never had a problem with service from the employees or food, as far as McDonald's go that aspect is pretty typical. The problem lays in the terrible people that occupy the lobby for hours on end. This is a place for people to flock with their computers and sit for 8 hours at a time. They leech off of the wi-fi and play their music loudly while they play games. It gets worse when they have breakfast wrappers sitting on their table at 4pm. If you want a seat to enjoy your meal upon, you're out of luck, and the idea of going in groups is directly out of the question unless you want to sit outside by a busy road. Until the management steps up and clears out lobby for the actual customers, i recommend trying the taco bell next door.
