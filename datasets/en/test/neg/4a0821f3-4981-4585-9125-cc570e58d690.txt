This is the worst golf course I've ever played on.  It was only $15 in the afternoon during the summer, and I still felt ripped off.  The greens were atrocious, most of them on the front nine had large dirt spots all over them and you could hardly tell where the green ended and the fringe began.  Everything here is old, and not in a vintage/antique way but in a terribly maintained way.  You'd be better off not golfing at all than playing here.
