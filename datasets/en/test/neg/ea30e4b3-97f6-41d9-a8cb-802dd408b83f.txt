Going to post every single day , as a family man was disrespect and treated as garbage by management (Tim) , food came out 40 min late in Scottsdale and accused of being intoxicated after one Budweiser and half a socki bomber .. charged us the full tab.. and when my daughter had a change of diaper a man in the bathroom was also rude and telling me to get outta the way while i was trying to but her diaper on while they have no family restrooms nor anything for her to lay on besides the floor ...will never go there again !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Worst Experience EVER!!!! i hope the have cameras so i can pull the tape GEEZEEE
