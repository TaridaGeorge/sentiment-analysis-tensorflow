Sure the lobby is fancy smancy but the pool is a hole in the ground filled with water and the rooms must have been left out of the recent renovation. 

They have a 4PM check in time and a noon check out time. 4PM seems a little too late, and seriously 4 hours to clean a room?

I also have not seen a TV that small in a hotel room let alone in any room since my grandma's kitchen. 

The price was ridiculously high for the room/TV/bathroom/ and pathetic pool.  Service was alright. $261 a night. 

The restaurant was beyond awful. Service was a joke and food was terrible. 

I would never stay at this hotel again.
