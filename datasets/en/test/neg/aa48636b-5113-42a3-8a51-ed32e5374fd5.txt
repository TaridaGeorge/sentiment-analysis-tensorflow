My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service. We had been there last year and it was pretty good but something has happened. It wasn't busy at all and now we know why. I ordered BLT on sourdough - got it on wheat, my husband ordered a burger medium and it was almost raw. The lettuce tasted and looked old, the crinkle fries are ok for frozen.The side of fruit was rubbery and tasteless. Don't think we will return.
