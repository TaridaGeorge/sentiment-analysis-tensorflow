I went to My Florist Cafe with my family once before.  The waiter was nice, but the food was unremarkable and overpriced.  I wanted to give it another chance while I was out with my sister and her two-year-old daughter.  My sister went to put our name on the waiting list and she told the hostess "three adults and a high chair please".  The hostess then gave her a look of disdain and said in the most sassy voice, "we don't have high chairs."  "Really? not even booster seats"  "NO"
We promptly took our business elsewhere.
