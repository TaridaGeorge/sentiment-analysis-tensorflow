In all ways, no way should you live at Broadstone Ancala. Property management style is unprofessional and problem resolution is questionable. The ventilation is horrible and air conditioning doesn't seems to do much. There are cheap materials used in the "renovated apartments." Only one pool seems to be operating at a time so  you are forced to use the front swimming pool with all the kids and beer guzzlers. I could go on... but not worth the time. Do yourself a favor if you are looking to live in Scottsdale, keep on looking.
