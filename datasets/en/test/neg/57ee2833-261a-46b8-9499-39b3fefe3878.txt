I went here for lunch.  The minute we walked in the smoke smell from their kitchen was offensive.  There were very few dishes under $13 and the portions are way too large.  Don't they understand people who pop out for an office lunch?  Even their "lunch specials" were $12 to $16!  The food quality was mediocre.  The waitress was excellent but, I wouldn't go back as there are so many other places I prefer.
