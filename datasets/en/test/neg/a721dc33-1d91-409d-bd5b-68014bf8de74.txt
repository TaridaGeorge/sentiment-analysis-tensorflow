in short: HORRIBLE TASTING FOOD!!! Far from authentic ofcourse.

Their selling spiel is all about how there is not butter or oil used. I would have been happy by that as long as they make sure the food is well cooked without too much oil. Their concept is to not use  butter/oil as cooking medium and then serve tasteless, undone food.

Samosas were bland and too soft (ofcourse not fried, not even pan tossed well) , bhel puri was a sham- like the worst ever. Veggie main dish was tasteless, very low on salt and spices. If that is a health-diet need, one could enjoy a meal there, but for tasting good indian food- this is JUST NOT THE PLACE.
