The food here is as bad as the restaurant name. We ate at their upstairs patio, the view was less than spectacular.  We ordered soda, and found out they pour it straight from the can, lovely. They also put a hot dog on a hamburger bun, weird. Their food is something anybody can make on their own cheaper and in less time. Their food is also overpriced for what you get.
