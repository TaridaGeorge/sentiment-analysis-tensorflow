I hate giving it one star. 

Salsa taste like marinara. I asked for the hottest salsa..still tasted like marinara. This is another Mexican food for white people. But what to you expect considering location? 

It's too expensive makes me want to open my own Mexican food place..I mean 4 $ for a taco?? 

The beans are good.. I hate the neon lights they hurt my eyes and make reading the menu a headache..

If you want better Mexican food go to la pi√±ata..
