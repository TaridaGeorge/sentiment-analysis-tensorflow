Well....I had been hearing about this joint for weeks.  So after spending New Years Eve on Mill Ave, the hubby and I were looking for more than the undesirable street fair food.  We walked on over to Five Guys.  The line was long; the place was packed! "MUST BE GOOD", we said to one anther.  $4 something for the Small Cheeseburger.  We each ordered a burger and shared an order of "their award winning fries" (sarcasm).  Thirteen dollars later and fifteen minutes, we received our food.  We rushed two blocks over to our hotel.  Now to make a long story short, save your calories, time, and money.  I have had a better burger from the Golden Arches, for a lot less money. Twelve dollars less.  Happy 2011!
