Maybe I went on the wrong day. But not even my dog liked it. We went to check it out since we read great reviews about the park and about people being regulars. It is nice to see the same faces. But it was not nice, not pretty, not big enough for us, people sits in closed circles which do not invite to sit next to them....so I do not know but maybe I went on the wrong day. Still, I definitely will not try it again,
