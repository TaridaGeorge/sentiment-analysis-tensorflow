Expensive place. Definitely clean and nice. The meal was not good-not fresh and the taste was very common. The cheese dip supposedly was with cheese from France but it was seriously tasting like Kraft cheddar from your local WalMart. Wine selection is good but again severely overpriced. Go to Whole Foods, pick up some good wine and some aged cheese and enjoy yourself.
