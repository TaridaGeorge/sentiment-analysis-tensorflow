Had the "house made" corned beef hash n eggs. Tastes like canned with some grilled onions. Our waitress was not nice at all. She didnt seem to want to be bothered with our order or grabbing us refills or anything. Not much of a wait, but you would think they were slammed.  Plenty of better places to go around here. Will not go back.
