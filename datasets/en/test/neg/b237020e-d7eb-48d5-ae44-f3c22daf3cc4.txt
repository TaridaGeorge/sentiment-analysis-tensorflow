4 girls, Wednesday night

Server was uneducated about the menu.
Food was ok
Maggiano's Salad tasted odd.  Only two of us tasted it then sent it back because of the smell/odd taste.  The two girls that tasted it (one being me) spent the next day with stomach pains and (me) in bed with an explosive situation (from both ends if you know what I mean)  Food POISONING???!!!

NOT GOOD!  Can't return.
