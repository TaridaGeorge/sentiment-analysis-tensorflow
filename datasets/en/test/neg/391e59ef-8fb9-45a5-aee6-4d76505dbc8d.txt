Every group fitness class is over crowded, especially the cycle classes.  People (usually women) hold bikes that are vacant and even challenge the instructor over them.  The management pretends to take action with complaints but does nothing.  It's $122 per month for a membership that gives you very little return at this location.  LifeTime seems to make more money off of new members than existing ones.  My advice; Don't throw your money away on this crap gym.  Yes, they have lots of amenities, but you can hardly ever use the group fitness classes, which is where most of your success will take place if you're serious about getting into shape.
