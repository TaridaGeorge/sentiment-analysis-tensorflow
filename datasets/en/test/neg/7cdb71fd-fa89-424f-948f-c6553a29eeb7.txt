This place sucks.  The idiot that wrote the glowing report about the bizzaro dr. edgecomb  must have been his mother.  He was nice but a real weirdo. 
 The arrogant and cold  dr. warfield is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.  They actually refused to send me my test results  because  "we don't have a 45 cent stamp in the file for your account" and instead insisted I pick them up at their front desk.  Fought with them for 5 weeks over a balance that I had already paid in full.  Doctors come and go very frequently here and there must be a good reason for it. I suggest  that every doctor their assistants  at this practice read the Hippocratic Oath for the first time.
