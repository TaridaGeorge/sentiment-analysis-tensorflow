so does anyone REALLY like the wal-marts?  half the time it is like a bomb goes off in one and no one to clean up on aisle 12!!  yes great prices, but man teh custoemr service stinks...but maybe you can't blame them for hiring people that don't care...because you get what you pay for right?  and walmart avoids paying waht they deserve...
