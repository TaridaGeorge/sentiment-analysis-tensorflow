Please do yourself a favor and pass on this sterile generic pretend Chinese restaurant.  I have been throwing up ever since I got home.  I was poisoned by their old seafood.  To top off a totally forgetable experience, after I ordered and tried to eat my marginal meal, they wouldn't even honor my coupon.  I will never eat at this place again . . .once I get over my food poisoning.  I can honestly say, Ambiance = non-existent, food = poisoned me, service = a horrible.  Please please please go to somewhere where they don't try to kill you.
