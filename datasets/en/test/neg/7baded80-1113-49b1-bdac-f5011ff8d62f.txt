Won't ever come back here again! I came in and was waiting in line to order a sandwich and was shocked to realize the people in front of me were actually his friends. Finally he took my order (very rudely like i totally bothered him) 2-3 minutes later and as I left he went back to talking to them instead of making my damn sandwich. No excuses for such poor service. Oh and by the way the sandwich sucked and was burned.
