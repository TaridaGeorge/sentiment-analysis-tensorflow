This place is straight up creepy and run down. Last time I went all the G&D insignia was gone and the menu seriously said, "Restaurant name to be determined" or something equally as ludicrous. Avoid at all costs. The menu is sub-par, the service is crappy, and the decor is about two decades out of date.
