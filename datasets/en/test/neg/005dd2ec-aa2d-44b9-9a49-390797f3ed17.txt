After this company no showed for their scheduled appointment with me-I emailed them to tell them how unprofessional this was. I got a response nearly 2 weeks later blaming a staff that had left the company and that she had canceled appointments and not told anyone ?? They said they would like to try to reschedule my appointment at a time that would work for me.  I scheduled another appointment but found out I had something come up for work.  I emailed them nearly 2 weeks in advance asking them to reschedule...no response! I emailed them again a week later...no response! This company is a JOKE! Don't waist your time!
