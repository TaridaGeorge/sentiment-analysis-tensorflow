HORRIBLE! 
Nothing on the menu under $10. Nothing on the menu worth $3!
Cobb Salad = $12.99 Salad drenched in dressing. A puddle formed at the bottom of the plate. It could have saturated an entire roll of Brawny Paper towels! 
Iced Tea $2.69! WOW.
Wife had Turkey wrap, inedible as well.
Thunder and lightning not fun for kids under 5. 

Overall Review. SUPER overpriced. Horrible food. WIll NEVER go back.
