Arrived today anticipating some great cheap grub. Walked in just before noon-not busy at all. 3 employees working behind the counter/kitchen. I was never acknowledged. They stared at me a few times....blankly!
I kind of gestured to them like....okay....let's get with the program.
Nothing, nada, zip.
After 3 awkward minutes I left.
