Are you kidding me?  This place was far from any Vietnamese place I have ever tried.  It is unfortunate that most people who gave this a glowing review have either never had authentic Vietnamese food, or have no taste buds.  There was no flavor!  I had to put hot sauce on my food to give it some flavor!  And the kicker is that this place is owned by a white guy.  LOL...you have been warned!
