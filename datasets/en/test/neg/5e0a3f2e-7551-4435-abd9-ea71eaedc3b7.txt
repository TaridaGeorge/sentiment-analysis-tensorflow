"Uhm, we don't give out change here"... yes that's what I was told at the to-go register when I parked a few feet from the door at a metered parking spot by the restaurant, and merely asked to break a dollar so our party could eat here.  They don't give change.  They don't have a dedicated lot - they have metered parking right outside their doors.  Grrrrreat policy, Mellow Mushroom.

Food is on a par with the other MM in town.  Service varies depending on the server, many of which have attitudes.  Draft list is long, but much of it isn't of much interest to anyone who's been into craft beer for awhile.  

Good location on Mill.  Looks like that's why they'll stay in business, and for no other reason.
