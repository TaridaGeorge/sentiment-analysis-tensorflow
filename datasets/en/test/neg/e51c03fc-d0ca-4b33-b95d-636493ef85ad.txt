I usually poke fun at Olive Garden as having bland food for people that have no idea what Italian food should really taste like, yet I'd still choose them over Nick's. I've read and respect the other reviews, and perhaps we just caught a bad night, but Nick's was awful. We began with a service issue however that was minor and not worth repeating. That problem would have been easily overlooked if the meal was good. Instead, we got uninspired bland food that seemed like it came right out of the jar or box. The are too many quality choices in the area or not too far from he that are much better. I would not go back to Nick's.
