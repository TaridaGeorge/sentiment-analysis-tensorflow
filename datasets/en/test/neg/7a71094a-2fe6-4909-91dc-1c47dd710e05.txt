The next time I really, really want to wait almost an hour for a cold, greasy burger....Cracker Barrel is just where I'll go.  My husband ordered pancakes and they were cold as well.  I thought it was a little strange that the room temperature butter that had been sitting on the table since we arrived, wouldn't even melt on these pancakes.  The waitress even commented when she finally brought our food, "Its about time, right?".  Well, she would know since she's the one who let the food sit up there in the window for so long that it was stone cold when it got to the table.  UGH, never again.
