I rely on Yelp reviews more often than I take the initiative to write one. That will no longer be the case. 
Like others, we noticed how empty the place was at 6:30 on a Saturday night, never a good sign and  $80 a head later we understood why.  
Linguine with clams not much flavor.  Laughing Bird Shrimp Risotto, very bland and soupy.  Orecchiette overpowered by salty "local sausage".  Special on the menu, Gnocchi with Chorizo was just ok. 
Not the quality we expected.
Caesar salad was good but pricey. Tiramisu was served in a chocolate cup, unique and tasty.   
Service was slow. Other tables appeared to be hotel guests not locals.
