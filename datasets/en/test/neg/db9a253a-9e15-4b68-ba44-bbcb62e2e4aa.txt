This place really sucks I went in there to rent equipment and the staff acted like they didnt want to help anyone out. I mean I know working sucks, but come on it's your job. So I give this place one star for the staff being rude, and the fact that i had to go to the Ski Pro in Mesa to rent the clothes that fit me. In the end I wish I had rented everything from the Ski Pro in Mesa. Mesa Ski Pro is a lot more polite and will be more than willing to help you find what you need.
