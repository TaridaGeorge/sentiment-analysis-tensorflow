UNION HILLS AND 7th AVE LOCATION!!

I went to Roberto's 3 or 4 of times, the food is pretty good, nothing amazing though. The staff isn't too friendly. On my last visit, after I ordered and was waiting for my food, I noticed I never received a receipt and was over charged roughly $2.50 on my $10 order!!!!
Thinking back, I realized I had never been given a receipt during any of my prior visits. I didn't even bother saying anything. I guess the tips I left in their tip jar just weren't enough.
When I got home I went onto their website but no contact email was listed, I then tried calling their restaurant in Anthem a few times to possibly speak to a manager, no answer.
No need to say, I won't be back.
