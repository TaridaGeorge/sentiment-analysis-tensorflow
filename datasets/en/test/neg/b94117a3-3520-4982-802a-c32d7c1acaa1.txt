Ha, how I long for the good old days! The days when you would sit in the back patio of Tonto Bar and Grill, soak up the great atmosphere while anxiously awaiting a succulent dish to please your pallet and a healthy appetite.

Well, those days are gone!  Our experience last night left us so disappointed. The passion to deliver a total quality dining experience is gone and so are we, never to return again.
 
It's about the money now, your money, and how much they can get for as little as they can give. So keep in mind, these restaurants that once burned brightly have a responsibility to earn your business every time you pull a chair up to their table. Tonto Bar and Grill's light has been extinguished only to be surviving off a once was reputation.
