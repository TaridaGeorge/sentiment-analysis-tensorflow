If Chinese buffet is what you desire, just keep driving northwest on Grand to the other place!  

The food is low quality and the place is one of the dirtiest I've seen in the Valley!  They do have a friendly staff and a vast selection, and so I can award them one star.  

Overall this is as bad as it gets, and would have to be starving to walk away satisfied eating here.
