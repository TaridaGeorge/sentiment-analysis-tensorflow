This place is one of the worst food quality and service I have ever gotten. I ordered the seafood stew and seafood pancake. Actually It was a groupon deal $22 for 2 entree with 1 appetizer up to 68% off value. However, there was nothing worth over $14 entree. It's basically a full price for what you get from Groupon without any deal. The worst part is the food quality. In the seafood stew, there was not much seafood except few crab legs. I want negative star rating but it is not possible, so I'm giving one star.
