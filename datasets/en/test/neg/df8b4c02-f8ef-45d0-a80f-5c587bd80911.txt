I had a horrible experience with this place so I may be biased. I went in the middle of the summer to reserve a spot for coworkers. I was sweating, overheating, hungry and miserable. I went next door to get a snack, the bartender completely ignored me for 10 minutes. When he did come over he was snooty and a real bastard. I ordered olives to keep myself from passing out, that took another 15 minutes. He brought it, I gave him a 5 and he never returned with my change! He didn't deserve my money!!
But once we finally entered the pizzeria it was boring and overhyped. The wait staff was just as uninterested as the bartender and never brought refills or a glass of water!!
Seriously, eff this place
