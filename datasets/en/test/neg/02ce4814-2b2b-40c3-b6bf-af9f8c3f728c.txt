My friends and I are on a road trip from Sacramento, CA to Austin, TX and wanted good subs. When we opened them in the car we saw that there was barely any meat on the sandwiches and all the pickles were pretty disgusting.  We do not understand why this place has such a great rating....we do not recommend it at all.
