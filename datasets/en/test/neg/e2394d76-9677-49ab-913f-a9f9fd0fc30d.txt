I'm not a fan of fried burgers, and I gotta say the burger was weak, no flavor to it.  Was as if you bought a package of ground beef, put it in a frying pan at home and didn't season it at all.  Best Burger in Jacksonville they advertise?!?  Thanks, now I know I don't need to ever visit Jacksonville.  Actually, they have signs ALL OVER the place touting themselves . . . ya know, you could take down the signs and let the food speak for itself, but . . . yeah you can't let the burger speak for itself when the burger sucked.  Let's put up more signs!

The toppings options were awesome.  I can't see myself going back for a burger, but the toppings might get me in to try a hot dog
