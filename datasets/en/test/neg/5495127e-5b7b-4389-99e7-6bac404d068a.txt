I came here years ago to see Henry Rollins Spoken word. (Totally awesome by the way: five stars.) The seats here though were absolutely HORRENDOUS! Now I'm 5'11" so I'm used to not having a lot of leg room so I'm used to sitting sideways so my knees aren't banging into the seat in from of me. Here, legs to the side and I'm still rammed up against the next row. It was like being in a three hour yoga pose. 

I have never before and never since seen rows of seats so close to eat other. Only my sister in law could sit comfortably and she's 5'1". Come on Celebrity Theatre, just a couple more inches. Size really does matter. If anyone told you otherwise, they were lying.
