this place sucks.  i went on a friday and sat outside, as the people we were meeting are smokers,  i had to wave down a server, who had no enthusiasm, sense of urgency, character, or personality.  and instead of working she sat at a table near us and had her own smoke.  there are so many better places in old town than this hell hole.
