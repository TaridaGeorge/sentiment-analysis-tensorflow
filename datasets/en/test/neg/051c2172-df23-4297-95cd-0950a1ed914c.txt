I stopped by the new Krispy Kreme at 7th & Roosevelt this past saturday and bought a coffee and a couple donuts, just to check it out.  We went to the science museum downtown, so we drove right by it twice.   It was pretty dead both times (1 & 4pm).   They didn't do much to change the interior sinec it was REV coffee, kept most of the TI's that were already in place.  Coffee was okay, not bad per se, but just typical convenience type coffee. It was very hot when served (too hot).   Compared it with the Dunkin Donuts decaf that we later got, DD was of course better.   Out of their 2 donuts, one was too "fried".  DD won on donuts too!
