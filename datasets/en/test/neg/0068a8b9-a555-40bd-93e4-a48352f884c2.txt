I hesitated to write this review.  Normally I am a very positive and optimistic person.  However, I felt I had a duty and responsibility to future GCU students to warn them.  I was a student of Grand Canyon University for 1 semester.  This was 4 years ago.  I was completely unsatisfied with the quality of the classes and instruction.  Ever since this time, Grand Canyon University has used "snake-like" tactics to try and extort money from me.  I believe they are intentionally fraudulent and are taking advantage of a convoluted system and communication channels.  I am frankly quite shocked that a self proclaimed Christian based school would use these types of tactics to illegally get money from their students.
