This place was decent, I have eaten here a few times.  My last visit was on Friday!!! Monday morning I drove by and no sign out front, I swung by later that day to investigate.  They are not just closed, BUT GONE everything from the chairs to the oven in back.  The sign says they left because of structural defects in the building. "Like what the landlord threatend to lock them out." No Restaurant just up and vacates unless you owe a lot of money. "Classy move"
