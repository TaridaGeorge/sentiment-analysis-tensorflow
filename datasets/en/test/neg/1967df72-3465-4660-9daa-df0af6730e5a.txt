Not a place I would go back to!  My husband and I ate there while at Squaw Peak Resort.  Soup was great.  I ordered fish tacos which included  two tiny pieces of fish on cold flour tortillas.  My husband had rib steak which was very thin.  We wanted to bring our own wine - 25 dollar corkage, we opted to purchase bottle. They didn't have the wine we ordered so settled for something else.  Squaw Peak Resort was equally dissappointing.
