Never take your scripts here. They will lose them and deny it.

The staff is rude and will refuse to serve you if you say anything near snarky.

Strange people loiter there, they have no restroom and ask you to leave backpacks/whatever at the counter. The restroom situation is a bit confusing, especially if you wait for a script - one, that they will lose/file your insurance wrong/whatnot - for eons... you have to go to the library to go potty. Even though the bathrooms are within eyeshot.

I have since changed insurance companies and will NEVER go there voluntarily again.
