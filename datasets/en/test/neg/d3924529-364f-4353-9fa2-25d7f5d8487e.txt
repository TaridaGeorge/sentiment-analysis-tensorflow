I like our airport, I think it is pretty nice. 

This is about security which I guess is a part of the airport. 

It is getting tiring. 

Old prune faced woman snarking at you, tiring. 

Say you have an artificial leg, you get the honor of being pulled aside. OK fine check the leg, but for God sake what is with this wiping the hands down and then the leg. I never see anyone else getting there hands wiped. If you do not find a bomb attached to the leg, leave the hands alone and lets just get on with it. 

Really gets tiring for a people who travel a lot.
