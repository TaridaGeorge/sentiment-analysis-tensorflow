For a sports bar, they sure don't have any channels that have sports, other than the ones you get with basic cable. (Yes, I know they're in an airport, so I shouldn't expect much, but still...how 'bout at least one premium sports package?)

So much for trying to watch a hockey game while trying to kill 4 hours at PHX because our flight got delayed AGAIN. Not sure what it is about my Spring Training trips...this is the third year in a row my flight home has been delayed over an hour.
