Poor service. Everyone was milling about when our party of 7 walked in and no one wanted to do anything...this type of lackluster attention continued. The drinks were awful. $3 margaritas sounded too good to be true and my watermelon one tasted completely artificial like they melted a jolly rancher into it or something. Blech.
