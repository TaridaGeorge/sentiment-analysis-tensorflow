bad day? wrong order? I was so excited to try this place and was rather disappointed. The veggie wrap my friend ordered was bland and very unexciting. And the bowl I ordered tasted like canned mushroom soup - is it a bowl or is it a soup? Neither of us finished our food...
The service was trite... one minute I'm giving my order the next i'm being ignored... and then poof, i'm ordering and then sort of being helped... abrasively but with a smile... no thanks....
I totally enjoyed my chai latte... but probably not going back anytime soon...
