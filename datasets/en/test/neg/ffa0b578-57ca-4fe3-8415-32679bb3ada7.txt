I have been doing Bikram for almost a year now and something you hear constantly about is the crucial role of savasana, a.k.a the relaxation period between each poses, and its importance in the regeneration process following each pose.

Here, they use this moment, when you lying on your back for a few seconds, to sell you their latest packages and specials. One message like that could be acceptable, but last time I went, right before Jan. 1st, every savasana was used to sell the 30 days challenge, the importance to come to Bikram every day, the "Bring your friend package", etc. 

Went there twice, and won't go back. Phoenix has an impressive amount of studios, and the one on Camelback was way more welcoming and respectful of all the postures of my practice.
