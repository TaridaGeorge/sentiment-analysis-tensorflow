Called from out of state because I found them on Yelp.  Wanted to send a local family a nice Easter package of baked goodies.  Woman who answered the phone was completely unhelpful and condescending... I just don't understand at all what the deal was.

I'm not sure why they wouldn't want me to spend money in their shop.
