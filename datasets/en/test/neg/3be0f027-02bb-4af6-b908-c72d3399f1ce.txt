This place is garbage, just another hyped-up trendy Sushi joint that "tries" to make up for their lack of quality with a "hip/modern atmosphere".  Been there once, will NEVER eat there again. The sushi is not good, the rice in our dish was hard, and the food was way overpriced. Of course, they have the usual airheaded ditzes and douchebags serving you food as if it's hurting them to smile. Don't waste your time with this pathetic attempt of a Sushi bar.
