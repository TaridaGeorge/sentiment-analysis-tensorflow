So, apparently the reason they charge you $35 to if you return the car to a different location is because we had the 3-day special. The 3-day special has lots of restrictions. 

We had to pay $6 per day for an extra driver, plus gas. So, the initial quote of $65, tax included for 3 days, for an economy vehicle was far from right. We ended up paying $106, taxes and gas included without returning it to a different location.

Get the 3-day special only if one person is driving, and you are returning it to the same location. Anything else and you end up paying double the quote.
