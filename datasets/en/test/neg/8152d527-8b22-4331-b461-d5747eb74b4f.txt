My ex-boyfriend really favored this little 50's styled diner and we always got breakfast when we went there.  It's clean and the staff are friend, but there wasn't anything on the menu that really stood out.  Just greasy eggs and hash.  What took this review down to 1 star was the egg white and spinach "omelet."  I don't know what that thing was *really* made of but it looked like a big green and while football sitting on that plate and had about that much flavor and the same density.  Pretty disgusting.  I did what I could to dissuade him from this place any time I could.  Icky!
