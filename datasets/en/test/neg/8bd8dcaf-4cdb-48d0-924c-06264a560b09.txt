This course has gone down hill drastically.  They are under new management but the course is not maintained at all, or at least very little.  If your looking to get out and just practice then it is fine.  The fairways are turning to dirt and the greens are really bad.  I play there because it is close but as in another review, you get what you pay for.  The prices for the course are too high.  I don't know what happened from last year but I am looking to golf somewhere else.
