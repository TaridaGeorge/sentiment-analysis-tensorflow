My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since. The food was really unspectacular, they weren't really that hot. The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly, the staff was not nice.
