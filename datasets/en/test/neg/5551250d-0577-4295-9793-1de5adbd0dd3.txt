Such a pretty restaurant with such badly prepared food.

My pulled porked sandwich had VERY little pork (2 chunks, not pulled), hard as a rock, flavorless. The coleslaw was also flavorless and did not taste fresh. They served me my food after 1 min of ordering... so i know they didnt make it fresh. 

It tasted like pure bread with a hint of "other-stuff" in there. its a shame too, cause i love pulled pork sandwiches. The side salad was just lettuce..... not really a salad at all.

For an $8.50 sandwich, you can afford to put well-cooked pork and freshly made coleslaw with an actual salad. Cheapos.

Get your act together Hillside! Your lunch was a dissapointment.
