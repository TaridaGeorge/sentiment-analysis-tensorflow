This place should not be in business!
I thought this place looks like a dive, but the food COULD be really good.  The food was terrible.  I ordered 1 lb. each meat for take out.  The pulled pork, beef and chicken was rather dry and chewy.  The ribs were cold, dry, and very chewy.  I think the food has been stored too long and just reheated in the microwave.  Also, I asked if I could just order the ribs as meats by the pound for take out and no sides.  He said yes and then charged me the full dinner price and gave it to me without sides.  The sauce was this orange brown watery substance that I would not call BBQ sauce.  The final touch, is that their attitude and customer service is really BAD!
