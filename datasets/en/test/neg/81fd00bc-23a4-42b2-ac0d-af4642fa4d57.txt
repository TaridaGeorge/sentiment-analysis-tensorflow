I've had a few good run ins with the brakes plus on 83rd Ave and Deer valley, but I thought I would give this one a try because it was closer at the time. Big mistake. They tried to get me to buy a bunch more stuff, some of which was brand new and just recently replaced. Very shady place. Stay away!
