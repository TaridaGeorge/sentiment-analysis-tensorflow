NYPD claims to taste like NY pizza because they use "Yonkers water" in their dough.  I grew up in Yonkers. My benchmark is Carlo's Pizza at the corner of Central Avenue and Tuckahoe Rd.  That is my neighborhood.  Yonkers wins the NY State water flavor championship on a yearly basis, so to make such a claim piqued my interest.   NYPD is some of the worst pizza I've ever had in my lifetime.  

We ordered pizza with tomatoes on top.  When I picked up the pizza and brought it home, I realized that the tomatoes were stale.  Yes they gave me a refund, but anyplace that serves pizza with stale toppings isn't worth my time.  I've never eaten there since.

If you want authentic NY Pizza forget NYPD and go to Ray's at the corner of Pima and Frank Lloyd Right.
