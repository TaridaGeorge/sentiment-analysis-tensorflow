I had my transmission replaced here and 2 months later it went out again because they installed it improperly. They tried to then make me pay for labor to replace it! After I threatened with a law suit they said they would cover their work, but It has been three weeks since then. ABYSMAL COMPANY! WATCH OUT! Did I mention that they haven't even started working on it in that 3 weeks?
