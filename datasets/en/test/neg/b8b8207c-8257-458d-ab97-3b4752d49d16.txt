VERY dangerous, work there as a merchandise processor for 7 day. my body could  not handle the horrible working conditions such as broken syringe needles stabbing through our flimsy gloves. i would also like to point out that customers go through the garbage before it came to me so i wonder how many people it stabbed. all my tests came back negative. thank you lord.
