I've been here a couple of time and was satisfied.  However, the last time I went, I swear they downsized their food -- the pizza slice was smaller and the small salad was dinky (maybe two bites worth!).  The price stayed the same however.  I know we all have to pinch our pennies during these tough economic times, but making the food smaller and charging the same = not cool.
