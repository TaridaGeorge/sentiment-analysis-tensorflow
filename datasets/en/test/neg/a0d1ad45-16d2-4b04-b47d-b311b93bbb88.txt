Went to this restaurant based on Yelp reviews...was very disappointed.  First, the restaurant is located in a strip mall so it lacked a great deal in ambiance.  Second, for the prices of the menu items, I expected the food to be much more flavorful.  I believe their number one ingredient is butter since that's what everything tasted like.  I would not recommend this restaurant and will not be returning.
