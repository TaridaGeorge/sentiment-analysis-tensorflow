BUMMER ?
I had high hopes for this place. I actually drove by once a week to check on the construction progress before they opened. Perfect location, craft beer, outside seating, old red brick building atmosphere! I was stoked! 

Long story short: I have tried the food and beer here four times over several months and it is not good. And what is with those baby diarrhea green walls and chairs, talk about a 100 year old red brick wall buzz kill. Service is really slow and blah. It is like they hire just anybody and then turn them loose without any training. 

I may try them again in a year or two. I am really bummed...this place had a lot of potential.
