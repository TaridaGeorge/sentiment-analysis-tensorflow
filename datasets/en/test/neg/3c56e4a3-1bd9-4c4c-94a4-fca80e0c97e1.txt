Absolute rubbish and RUDE service by the day time waitress.  Greasy fries that were "hand cut" and very slow service resulted in a nearly 2hr lunch that left none of us satisfied.  Don't waste your time, the Tilted Kilt is in the same parking lot and offers far better food (I can't believe I said that) and far friendlier service.
