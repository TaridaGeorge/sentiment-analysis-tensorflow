This store needs to get with the 21st century. No online ability to take money. Won't take credit cards over the phone. Won't take American Express. Cutting themselves out of a big market.

For local purchases with better customer service and convenience I prefer Tempe Camera Repair. They at least choose to accomodate customers.

Don't know how this store stays in business.
