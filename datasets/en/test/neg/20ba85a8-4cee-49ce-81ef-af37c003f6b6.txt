Wow. The only word that I can use to describe the sushi here is terrible. It was totally tasteless, and that after I waited 30 min (10 extra) to get takeout. I was almost suckered into getting a drink at the bar waiting the extra 10 minutes... $25 was enough for the two tasteless roles and cold edemame.

It is a very chic space and I would imagine the ambiance would be nice for a happy hour or date. However, I just can't get over the sushi.
