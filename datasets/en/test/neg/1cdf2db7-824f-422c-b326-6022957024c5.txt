I simply can't give a good review based on this place being as close to kosher-style as it gets in the Valley. Even if I've had a black and white cookie from Chompie's and gone all memory lane on it; it just becomes a disservice to the places back east that Chompie's tries to ape. :'(  

It is overpriced, overcrowded, has bad service, and is overwhelmingly mediocre. It isn't even the "authentic" overpriced, overcrowded deli with bad service, it takes that treasured business model and plays it out with the cruel soullessness of Sun Belt suburbia.

Chompie's is one of the few restaurants I feel guilty about being taken out to because I feel it is such a rip-off.
