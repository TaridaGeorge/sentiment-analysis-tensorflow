Horrible. This place has not changed since I worked there 24 years ago. Granted, I was the worst busser in the world, but that does not excuse the bad food, old decor, tired menu, and lackluster staff. 

The food is essentially taco bell but more expensive. The guacamole is neon green without flavor, the food swims in grease, and the beans and rice are often cold by the time they get to the table.

There are better restaurants just a few minutes away.
