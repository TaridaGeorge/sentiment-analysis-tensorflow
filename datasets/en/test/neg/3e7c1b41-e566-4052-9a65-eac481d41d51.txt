Needless to say, the ice cream is amazing!! The reason as to why I gave it one star primarily deals with the fact that the "management/ownership" treat their employees in a completely unprofessional manner. For example, on multiple occasions, I have seen employees scolded for "over-scooping." With regards to the price, the portions are not proportional to what you pay. I suggest you go to Whole Foods; they have the same ice cream without the lack of professionalism and skimpy portions.
