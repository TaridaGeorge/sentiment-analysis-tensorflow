I agreed with reviewer, ' Ima yelp'.  What a rip off.  $12.00 for a small bowl of noodles. I find nothing special about their food that can justify double price.  Taste, texture, ingredient, serving size - everything is the same as other Vietnamese restaurants that normally charge between $5 -$ 7.00.
