I had a nail in the driver-side front tire of my wife's 2008 Rav4. I took it here for a repair. The manager told me it could not be repaired and the only tire they had for me was $100. I went for a second opinion at Discount Tire which repaired my tire in 10 minutes at no charge. I won't be coming back here.
