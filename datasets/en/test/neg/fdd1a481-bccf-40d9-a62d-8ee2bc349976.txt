I was not only blown away by how uninterested the girl was that was teaching this "Cookie baking class" this Novermber but how RUDE she was to the only male that was in the class with us!

It was like she was extremely upset that a man decided to take the class and treated him rudely the entire time. I was bothered by it the entire time. Not only was I bothered by it but myself and 3 other girls all told him after the class that he should ask for his money back. And he should.

I would not recommend the Sweet Basil classes or cooking school to anyone that is looking for a pleasurable experience as the blonde lady who teaches the classes (i believe her name was Melissa) seems absolutely miserable and unhappy with her job.

Hopefully the owner reads this and takes note.
