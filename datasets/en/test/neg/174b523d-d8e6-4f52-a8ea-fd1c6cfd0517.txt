I would NOT recommend this Pets Mart to take your dog for a grooming. I have a West Highland White Terrier and took him in for a traditional Westie cut. He came back with a "cocker" cut, not a Westie cut and looked ridiculous. I took him a few days later to another groomer and they asked me "Who did this?" I told him Pets Mart, North Scottsdale and they said that he was not groomed to the breed standard and that his "genital" area and arm pits were not done to regulation and it was not sanitary!! Will not be going back there. I think their employees need better training. They don't seem professional to me at all.
