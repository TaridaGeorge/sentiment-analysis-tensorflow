The food at Brunchies is okay, however, the manager, Caroline, is not very accommodating for large groups of professionals that would like to hold meetings every week.  Simple requests to save our spot, turning down the music, flexibility with breakfast specials, etc., etc. is not welcomed and met with NO I CAN NOT DO THAT since I have other customers!  Well if this local eaterie is to survive, the Serrano family needs to know how to manage their employees.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BRUNCHIES!  I suggest spending your $$$ at another local restaurant that appreciates you!
