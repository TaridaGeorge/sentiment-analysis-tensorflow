This is an update to my earlier review. I happened to check my oil today and thank God I did.  4 QUARTS LOW!

Only three things are possible. 1. Oil leak  2. Oil burning  3. Insufficient amount of oil was put back into my truck after putting the engine back together. I'll give you a hint which two problems it isn't.

BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY.
