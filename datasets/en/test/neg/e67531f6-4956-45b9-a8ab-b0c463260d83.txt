I wish I couldn't even give it one star, my husband and I went in there for a quick bite before going grocery shopping. We went to the counter; we were not greeted for one, two they all looked at both my husband and I like we don't belong in here because of our skin color and two they all spoke spanish not one drop of English! I'm sorry, but if you are going to work in a fast food restaurant in America you better start speaking our language. I will never go to this one EVER again!
