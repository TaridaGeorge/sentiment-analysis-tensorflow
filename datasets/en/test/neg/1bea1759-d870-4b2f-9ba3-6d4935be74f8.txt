The place was dead when we got there at 7pm, we were the only table there. For starters the samosas were very small for the price and the exterior crust overly thin and the filling was very crumbly with no flavour. My palak paneer came with no rice...has to pay $5 extra for it which made that more expensive than my friend's chicken dish wtf??? And to top off this whole experience I have not been able to be more than 10 ft from the bathroom today :-) There have to be better places elsewhere...
