This is the most dishonest jeweler in all of Scottsdale. Their product is way below par and the service is atrocious. My wife had a problem with her engagement ring and they tried to fix it but only made it worse and then went on to belittle my wife multiple times stating that she knows nothing about the business and that I am only a salesperson so what would I know about customer service. 
They never fixed the problem and I will be reporting them to the BBB and I am sure they will still not fix anything. If you run into this company, make sure to run, run, run as fast away as you can.
Do not trust a work they say and do not trust their products. 
Worst business relations EVER!
