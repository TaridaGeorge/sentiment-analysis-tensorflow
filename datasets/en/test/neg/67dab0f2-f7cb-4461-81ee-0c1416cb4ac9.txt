What a great looking bar. Too bad that's where the good things stop. We decided to stop in for a couple drinks before last night's Foo Fighters show. Little did we know they would be so woefully understaffed. Maybe if the 3 bartenders balanced their attention between the inside customers as well as the outside, I would return. Sadly, I will not. I'd love to give a food review, but something tells me, I'd still be waiting. (tip for the owners...when you have big events downtown, please plan your staffing. Downtown Phoenix is trying to "rise from the ashes" and your not helping.)
