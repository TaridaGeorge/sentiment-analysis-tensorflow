Lousiest  H&M customer service i've ever experienced! 
Picked out some grey outfit & i was looking for a tie that's close to grey. I asked an employee by the name of Jaclyn where the ties were. All she said was ties  would be in the suit area & all they have is maroon & black. She didn't bother showing me exactly where they were as she was too busy lollygagging with another employee. I went to the suit area & it turns out they have a bunch of grey shaded ties hanging across from the black & maroons. So disappointed with the service at this H & M. By the way, none of the employees ever smiled nor greeted their customers...Horrible service!
