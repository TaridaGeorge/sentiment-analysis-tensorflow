Sapporo is the place to go if you don't really want to eat.  Go for Happy Hour to hang out on the patio with the beautiful people in Scottsdale.  My friend and I went for Happy Hour, the bar area was full so we sat at a bar table near the sushi bar.  

We'd ordered and were eating when the hostess came over and told us that we were no longer in the "bar area" and that these seats had to be assigned at the hostess station.  She was incredibly rude and pretentious.

The food and the atmosphere are no were near as appealing as RA. The Happy Hour menu was not as extensive and the food wasn't all that great.  We never went back.
