Disappointed in my experience in Discount Tire over the Labor Day weekend.  Bought 4 new tires and left the car with them.  Took them over 2.5hrs to put the tires on the car, which is longer than I have experienced in past visits.
Got the car back in the late afternoon and drove it around for a bit.  The next morning I come out and TWO tires are completely flat.  I fill them back up and can hear the air leaking out of the value stem, which is usually due to faulty installation.  Of course these guys are never open on Sunday and Monday is a holiday.  So I'm stuck without my car for 2 days.  Maybe they will make it right, but pretty much ruined my long weekend.
