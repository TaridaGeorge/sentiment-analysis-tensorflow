This review is for Wendy the office manager. Rude, rude, rude 10 times over. Unprofessional, condescending, unhelpful and all with major attitude. An office manager should have at least basic communication and empathetic listening skills. Wendy should never have been put into a position that clearly requires more than kindergarten communication skills.  

Patients, take your co-pay's elsewhere if you want to be treated with any mount of dignity or respect. Gilbert Hospital on Power and Ray is awesome - I will never make the mistake of going to San Tan Urgent Care again. 

Hey Wendy, by the way, VERY unprofessional to hang up on a customer. Period. I have a Master's Degree and do not appreciate being scolded like I am in grade school. I'll tell EVERYONE I know to stay clear of your business due to your crappy attitude. Best of luck!
