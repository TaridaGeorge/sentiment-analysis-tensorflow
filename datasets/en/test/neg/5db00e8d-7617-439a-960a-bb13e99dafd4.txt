The service at this place is horrible. I hadthreepeople walk past me while i waited at the counter. Had no idea if i was suppose to sit down or order at the counter to eat in. Nobody asked me. When i told them i had never eaten here before, the gal was NO HELP. I clearly stated that i did not want some thing on my sandwich and it came with it anyway. I also got my sandwich served in a bag at the table, i guess that answered my question about where i was suppose to order. If this place plans to stay open in Scottsdale, they better get some better service going. Now i know why places with good food don't survive!
