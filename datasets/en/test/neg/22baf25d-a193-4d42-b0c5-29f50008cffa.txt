We went to this Golden Corral in Casa Grande, AZ 3-4 times after it first opened.  It was awesome!  BUT we went last week and it has REALLY gone down hill!  The food was not warm or fresh.  We went back again for breakfast but didn't get there til 10:30 am.  We asked it they were still serving breakfast and were told yes, but when we went through the line they were already taking breakfast stuff  away and there was'nt much left, so we went back to get our money  back and the girl at the check-out would not refund our money and actually turned her back on us!  We will never go back!  Who ever is managing this location is giving Golden Corral a bad name!
