I got food poisoning from the Lamb Vindaloo, the naan was hard and tough and we ordered one mild and two medium dishes and all were pretty hot. The lamb (which I have just about everywhere) was pretty tough too and not that great, so I only ate half. Good thing because the food poisoning may have been worse... Avoid! Service was good though.
