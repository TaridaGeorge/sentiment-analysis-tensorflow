I admit a 1 star is a bit harsh, but I am rating the Shepherds PIe.  If you have McBar shipped over from Ireland and serve Guinness, congrats to you and the hundreds if not thousands across the country to do the same.   Doesn't make you authentic.  

Now for the Shepherds Pie.  Gross.  Totally inedible, so I didn't eat it.   Btw, Sheep need a Shepherd.  Cows need a cowboy.  Shepherds pie is made with LAMB!  Either way this was gross.  The waitress was very nice and took it off the bill and I had some bacon-wrapped shrimp so I wasn't starving.  The Guinness was fine.
