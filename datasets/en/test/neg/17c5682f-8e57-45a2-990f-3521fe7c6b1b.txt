My dog USED to be a patient at this VCA Animal Hospaital for almost 10 years. The prices were steep but the care was good. I liked the vets there, but I stopped taking him there when I was refused an emergency appointment when my dog's adrenal system shut down and he almost died. I was told I could not get an appointment for 3 days because they were too busy...REALLY???  Fortunately Dr. Benesh at The Chandler Small Animal Clinic saw him immediately, diagnosed his problem, got him on an IV, kept him overnight & saved his life. These actions earned our trust and our business for life. My dog is now 17 years old and still going strong...
I filed a formal complaint with corporate. I did receive a VERY apologetic phone call, but it was too little, too late.
