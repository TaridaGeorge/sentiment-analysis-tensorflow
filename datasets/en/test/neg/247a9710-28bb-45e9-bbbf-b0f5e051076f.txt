Literally, the worst pizza I ever had. 
I've never scraped off the toppings just to avoid the crust before but there's a first for everything. And even the toppings were a sad excuse for something edible.
The waitress passed us a few times and even though we obviously looked displeased, she never bothered to ask if we needed anything or if the meal was alright. 

By the time the check came, all you saw were a couple empty beers and a cold disgusting pie asking to end it's misery.
