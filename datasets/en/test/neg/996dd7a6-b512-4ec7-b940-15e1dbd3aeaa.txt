This was the fourth place in my recent taco tour of Chandler, and I thought this place was authentic but not!!! Again, I went with the traditional Carne Asada and marinated portk. This place is comparable to filbertos and that is not a compliment. The marinated pork was actually pork with some chorizo seasoning on it, terrible. The Carne Asada was typical stale and bland. Is there something with seasoning here that people tend to try and  let the salsa do all the covering up. A good taco needs no salsa, just a little lime, the salsa should add just a little kick but not be the whole taste of the taco. Well, I should not expect too much from a chain, no matter if it is a hispanic chain or an anglo chain like taco bell. I also have to wonder who are reviewing these places also.
