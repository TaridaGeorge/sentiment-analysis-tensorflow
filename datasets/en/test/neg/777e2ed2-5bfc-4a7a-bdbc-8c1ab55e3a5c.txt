Oh dear.. my friend took me here because she was told it was good.  It was awful!  The place is cheesy.. the wait staff is incredibly rude and kind of inexperienced.. the menu is really poor.  How can half the rolls have cream cheese in it.  That's disgusting!  And I heard the sushi chef boast about how he can make anything yummy.  Ummm.. not with cream cheese you can't.

I had the crunch roll which was blegh.. and this other roll which was deep fried in tempura batter.  It was horrible.. not light and crispy at all.  They must have dunked it in flour.

The only thing I can say positively about this place is that.. the food looked orderly.  I didn't find a hair in it or anything.  Skip it and save your money.  This is Americanized crap here.
