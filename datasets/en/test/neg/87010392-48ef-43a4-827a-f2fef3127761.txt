Horrible pizza / Horrible service. I was hoping the pizza would make up for the rude service by an angry woman with a New York accent. Owner? Scarey! . . . but that didn't happen. The watery, tasteless sauce, sat on top of chewey, undercooked dough like soup. I have nothing good to say about my experience with Ray's Pizza. My father is from Brooklyn and even he would be shocked by the horrible service. Don't waste your money.
