I have been using this store for some time now and noticed the manager was always in a bad mood. As each time passed it just seemed odd the mood was always the same. Well this last time I spoke with Ted (manager) he tried to upsell items I didn't need. In asking questions as to why I would need them it aggravated him to explain. So much so that he got argumentative, my assumption is I didn't say "yes" to all the unnecessary items. I come to find out there is another store on 32nd st and Camelback, not far, that is great. Customers come first and when it becomes a problem just to do simple tasks I'd rather go elsewhere. Save yourself time and aggravation and use another store, not worth it.
