Billing is a huge problem! I was being charged 98.00 and 56.00 every month. We had to block them as a vendor and after emails saying the would correct it, we still get charged or attempts to run the card. They asked to hold the card on file for a month to month membership and it somehow turned into financing their gym. Same with my brother in law. It seems criminal.
