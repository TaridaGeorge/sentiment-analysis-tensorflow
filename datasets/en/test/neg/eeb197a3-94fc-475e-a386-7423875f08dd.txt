First of all, I'm out to have a good time on my birthday. The id checker told me that my birthday was yesterday even though it was 11 pm on my actual birthday. Then we get in and the bartender (male) looks over at the female bartender and goes, "are you going to get them?" to which she rudely replies, "no you get them". 

Everyone was rude from the get go. We just went to check them out. I give good reviews where ever I go. But I felt bombarded with rudeness and hated it. We walked out in less than 5 minutes. Don't do it!
