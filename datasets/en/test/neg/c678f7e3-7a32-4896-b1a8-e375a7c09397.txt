Theater was very warm, service was slow and order was incorrect yet we were billed for things we sent back. Ice cream was warm by the time we got spoons. Went to see Batman and this was do bad I think I will go to Ipic and see it again. I wasn't really a fan of the office chairs and thought they could have done a better job with the layout. People were walking in front of us the whole time the movie was on. 
I didn't complain at the theater because we aren't coming back and free passes, etc... Would have been useless. 
I hate to see a place try so hard to change things up and yet get it so wrong.
