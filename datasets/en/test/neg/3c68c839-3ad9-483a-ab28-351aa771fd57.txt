Love the venue. Loved the music. 

The security they have here is out of control.They make it very difficult to have a good time. From the invasive harassment at the front to the constant, in your face presence once inside the show, the security is there and they make sure you know it. 

We all want to be safe at a show but when the security workers are complete dicks to everyone, it makes the venue suck. We want to come here, have fun and spend our money at your establishment. Management/ownership should take a look at whoever is in charge of security. They're driving your customers away!!
