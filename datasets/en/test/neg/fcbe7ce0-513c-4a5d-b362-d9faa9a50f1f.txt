My girlfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. We were led to a table outside and told our waiter would be with us in a few minutes. We proceeded to sit there for over 20 minutes while no one came to our table .Numerous people were sat around us outside and the host came outside multiple times and seemed to just stare at us. We proceeded to leave .On our way out, the host had the nerve to just look at me and say "Thanks for coming in" with more than just a hint of attitude. The service at this place sucks and the hipper than thou attitude is a joke. Stay away.
