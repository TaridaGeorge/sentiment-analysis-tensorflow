I wish there was an option for ZERO stars.  I came here one late night after a night out in Tempe.  We went to Corleone's for two reasons - 1, we were hungry and 2, we needed to use the restroom badly.  As one of the few open places in the area, it seemed like a good plan.  However, after ordering our mediocre sandwiches, which we waited over 15 minutes for, we were told the bathroom is closed at night, even for the employees!

What kind of establishment is allowed to be open, serving food, and does not even have a restroom?

I think they should be shutdown.
