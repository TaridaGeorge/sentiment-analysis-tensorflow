OHSO?  More like NO SO. Stuffy atmosphere, less than exciting menu, and waitress had no idea what she was talking about. This is a micro brewery: your staff should at least know what a beer tastes like, not just vodka cranberrys out of a red cup! Plus she got the order wrong three times and offered a sample of beer I was unsure about and proceeded to charge me for the flipping sample, without mentioning it. Not cool
