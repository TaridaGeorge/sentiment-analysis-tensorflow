Straight from Wal-Mart to your plate.  

This was the most disappointing meal I've had in ages.  I watched the staff pull retail boxes of breadded fish from a freezer in the middle of the kitchen and serve them up.  

The portions were adequate, but not outsanding.

Throughout my 20+ years in the Valley I've heard Pete's was a great fish-n-chips place, but yikes!   Looks like i'm stuck with LJS for my fish and chips fix.

I'll never visit again.
