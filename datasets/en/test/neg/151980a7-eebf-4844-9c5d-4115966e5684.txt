These people have NO idea what they are doing.  As a person who has grown up eating the best BBQ (meaning chopped/pulled, seasoned pork shoulder) in the US (in eastern North Carolina), of course I am going to be a tough sell.  But I was open and very disappointed.  The meat on the pulled pork sandwich was not pulled at all, but rather sliced and in chunks.  Further to that, it was dry and tasted like it had been cooked over a gasoline flame. Yuk!  This place is great if you have no idea what the offerings are supposed to taste like.  I feel bad as I write this review, because the proprietors and staff are SO nice!  But between the dry chunks of gasoline flavored pork and the spoiled sweet tea, don't waste your time.
