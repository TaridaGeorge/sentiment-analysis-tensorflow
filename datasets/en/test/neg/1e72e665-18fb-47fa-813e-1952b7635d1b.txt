Well, I've officially eaten at this location for the last time. Over the last few years, it's gone from good food with nice/funny people working there to decent food with a miserable woman who scowls at you as she takes your order. We kept coming despite her rudeness because we liked the food/ familiarity.. Until last night. Ordered a quesadilla and I see that it has clearly been reheated (probably from a to-go order that no one claimed) . My friend's is piping hot and mine is warm but the cheese is dk orange/oily - like how melted cheese gets when it cools down. I don't know what's more insulting: getting served old food or them thinking I was going to be too dumb to notice. Consider hiring someone in the back who isn't too lazy to melt cheese into a tortilla if you want to retain customers.
