I am a fan of great pizza, and the two times I have been here, I have not experienced good pizza.  In fact, the last time my girlfriend and I ate at Pizzeria Bianco (a few weeks ago) we both got very sick.  I don't expect to like everything that I eat, but I certainly expect to not get paralyzingly sick after a $100 meal.  Sickness aside, the quality of pizza and appetizers at Cibo is far superior to that of Pizzeria Bianco.  I will never eat here again.
