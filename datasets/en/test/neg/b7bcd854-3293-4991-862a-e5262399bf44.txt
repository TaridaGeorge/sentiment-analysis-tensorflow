Can't even bother to elaborate... 

Batting cages are horrible... nuff said... look out in the baseball ones as they throw pretty crazy and the softball lanes are pretty non-accurate nor are they consistent.  The balls are really hard so don't bring a bat you wanna not crack.

The karts are shitty... even for lame little kid karts... 

Food is super gross, didn't play minigolf or games.

Pretty lame for a "fun" place
