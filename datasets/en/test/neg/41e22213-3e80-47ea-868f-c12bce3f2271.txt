Ugh...that pretty much sums up my experience at Thai Rama.  I was in AZ visiting family and took my family to eat Thai, expecting Char's to still be there.  When we arrived, saw that name was changed to Thai Rama...no big deal.  Place looked clean and the waitress was friendly.

I ordered my usual Thai dishes:
- Pad Thai (weird medicine taste...definitely wrong sauce)
- Pork Larb (too sour...not enough fish sauce...not as spicy as I requested)
- Pork Rad Nah (sauce tasted too bland...lots of sauce though)
- Tom Yum Gung (sigh...I can still remember the disappointment I felt as I tasted this seemingly "canned" soup)

I guess I am used to the authentic Thai food from Chars and Thai restaurants in L.A., so I had high expectations.  It's hard to find a good, authentic Thai restaurant in AZ.  I miss Chars!  

Would I go here again?  No.
