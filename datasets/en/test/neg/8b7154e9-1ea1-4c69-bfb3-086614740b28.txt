Went to dinner with three girlfriends.  Horrible experience.  Ice tea tasted horrible, and had to ask for replacement.  Only given two plates to share appetizer  for 3 people.  Waitress ignored our table, though the place had only two other tables seated.  Hair found in food.  Quality of food mediocre.  Won't be going back.
