Wow, so this place sucks..even WITH a handicap for being airport food. Here is why:

1. Only has 1 cooler with salads and sandwiches + a variety of sodas and water
2. It is ultra expensive and is about the size of my closet.
3. My Cobb salad lettuce appeared to be unwashed
4. The bleu cheese crumbles had melded together into a lumpy ball that I could literally lift with my fork.

Helpful tip: Do not fall pray to this CPK kiosk. Eat BEFORE you pass through the security line!!
