We did not have a good experience.

Apparently there was only one server and one cook on the Sunday afternoon that we visited the pub.  After waiting an hour for our food - an HOUR - the order was incorrect.  We were told it would be "another 10 minute wait" if we wanted the order corrected because that's how long it would take to "cook the fish".   Unbelievable.

To their credit, they did offer to comp our meal and we took them up on it.  However, between the obvious disorganization of the place and its lack of handicap accessibility, we won't be back.
