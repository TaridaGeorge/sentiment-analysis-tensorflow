I'm surprised with the high reviews for this place. Although our server was nice and my sweet brat was decent, it took far too long to get our food. My boyfriend also got food poisoned from their spicy brat. My iced tea tasted like water, and the water I got tasted like dishwater detergent. One star for the Belgian fries, which were excellent. Won't be returning and I don't recommend this establishment. There are far better places to eat at.
