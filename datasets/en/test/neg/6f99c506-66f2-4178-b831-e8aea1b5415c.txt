Service and management is poor and inconsistant. One minute we were told we could pay .69 cents to add pinnapple to their 8" pizza special as it was not one of the 8 or so toppings and sub mozzarella for provolone on the hoagie. Five minutes later the waitress returned to say the manager that had originally told her yes to our requests had been yelled at and we needed to place a different order. She explained something about food cost being the reason, but last time I checked mozzarella cheese and pinnapple are not expensive items. And beyond that you do not tell a table one thing and come back 5mins later and say something different. Disappointed in the mellow mushroom today.  ;(
