We ordered chicken  Parmesan for wife and daughter our first night in Phoenix.  The chicken was raw.   Seriously???  Due to poor lighting they ate some of it before realizing the chicken was raw.  I am not taking slightly undercooked I'm saying RAW!  We notified the manager and she was apologetic and gave us comp cards for next time .  Are u kidding?  No way at w going back there.  Wife and daughter got sick the next day.   Stay away!!!
