Made an appointment at the Portrait Studio for 5:30pm. It is now 6pm, and I am still waiting. They "close" at 6 and there is someone after me. The "consultant" is still talking through photo choices with the family who was here before 5:15 when I arrived. I came to take Maternity photos, and I feel like leaving, but this is really the only chance I have to get them done so I am trying to be patient. We will see what happens.

So, 50 minutes after my appointment time, I am still waiting. I walked out.
