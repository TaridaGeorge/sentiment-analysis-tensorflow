Extremely disappointing. I came by to this location for a return after purchasing a number of items at another store. Unfortunately, either I went on a off day or this is generally how this store operates. I went and there was only 1 open register. While there where FIVE other employees just standing in the front not doing anything. I was trying so hard to be very patient, but seriously no motion, no offer of the other employees to step up and open another register to help any other customers. What a shame. These employees are being paid to just stand there. At least the standing decor has purpose versus the employees. Ouch! Not only that but no one greeted any of the customers. Very sad.
