These people are horrible. I bought a phone and it went dead inn just a few hours and when I went to return it, they wouldn't without charging me an additional $35 fee. They were incredibly rude and also tried to blame me for it not working. All I did was pk Uganda it in to the charger and set it on the counter. They were willing to lose the account I have had with them for more than three years over this fee. One call to customer service and the fee was removed but the store didn't seem to seven care to keep my business.
