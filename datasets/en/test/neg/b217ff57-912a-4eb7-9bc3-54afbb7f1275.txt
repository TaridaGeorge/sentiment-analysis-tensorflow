I am really disappointed in this company, my husband's mother died suddenly. After scrambling to make arrangements, we paid a high price to travel this airline. I was told they did bereavement discounts and reimbursements. I emailed them and asked.

Nope, not at all. I guess corporation really do not care about people, they care about their profit margin. Well I promise you, they will not add any of money to the bottom line in the future. It is pretty obvious that they do not care about their customers at all. 

It truly is the little things that make people loyal to a brand. I will take my loyalty and business to another airline.
