I have been a member of LA Fitness since 2007 and the Camelback location isn't much better than the Northern location, although I hear they are completely rebuilding Northern. Every time that I would work out at Camelback, the equipment was busy/taken and I would have to alter my workout routine which I am dedicated to. So, after having to use random machines and messing up my workout routine, I decided to use the Tatum facility. Not much better. Very dirty, busy; people watching? It's a gross meat market. I want a workout, not to be checked out and judged. Thank You Village! You are my new home!
