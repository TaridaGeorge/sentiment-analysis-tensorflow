Do you remember being a little girl and begging for a bedazzler for Christmas? Desperately wanting to bling out your jean jackets and rhinestone your name on your backpacks? Do you still carry a torch for all things bedazzled? If so this is the store for you. 

From blinged out shirts to booty bedazzled jeans, you can find here and it has been covered in faux diamonds and rhinestones. There are also a ton of the dragon/angel/tattoo looking shirts that some ladies are so fond of. 

I don't know if  I should give this place one star or five stars.. I guess it really just depends on your taste in clothing. I wouldn't be caught dead in anything they sell here. But I know a few ladies that may be willing to trade in a Michael Jackson purse for a sparkling hat with "Hot Thing" written in rhinestones.
