Order a pizza  for delivery. The $10 special, looked good on TV. It was the WORST pizza that I have EVER had. The thin crust was thicker than the topping, the very minimal topping, little sauce, very little cheese, thin amount of topping. After ONE bite, we boxed it up and went out to get something to eat. Absolutely Horrible.
