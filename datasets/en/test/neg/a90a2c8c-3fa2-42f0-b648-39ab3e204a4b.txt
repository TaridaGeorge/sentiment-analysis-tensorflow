I've lived in the midwest so I know what a great concert venue is supposed to be like, and its not Cricket.  

If its 110 degrees outside (which it almost always is, if not hotter in the summer months) its 125 degrees in and around Cricket.  The acoustics are horrible, you cant hear anything anyone says if youre out on the lawn.  Parking and leaving is a total disater, I've had to wait in that parking lot for over an hour to get out.  And if all that wasnt bad enough, you'll go broke buying drinks.  

If you want to be sweated on by a total stranger, you'll love Cricket Pavillion.
