I don't write reviews, but for this stay I want to share my experience... First, we were given the wrong room (no big deal), second, when looking for hotels they said they had infant cribs on request... I called the front desk  for a crib, they told me that housekeeping was not in, but they could get one for me in the morning, why would I need one in the morning when we were only staying one night?... Third, the heat in our room was not working (during Christmas time) and traveling with two children under 2, you really want everyone comfortable.  The only good thing about the hotel is the women ho worked the front desk were really nice.
