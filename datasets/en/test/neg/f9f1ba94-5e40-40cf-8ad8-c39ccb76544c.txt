Awful Yogurt. How the hell can you screw up the flavor "Chocolate?" Well, Mojo Yogurt can. And they have. I wanted to puke after I took a few spoonfuls in the hope that the next spoonful would be better somehow because it looked like chocolate and it said it was chocolate so it MUST be chocolate...but no. It was just grossness. Oh and the $8 price for it was the last straw.
