despite it's billing as the 'largest thrift store in north america,' i'm pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items. the place is huge, but i've never, ever found anything good in this store. i'm not sure how that's possible. but i would never go out of my way to shop here.

i have no bathroom report for this location because i've never been in there long enough to actually go.
