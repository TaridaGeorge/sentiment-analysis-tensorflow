I've eaten here many times in the past few years, and the food was always fabulous.  Not so this last time.  The food was AWFUL.  I assumed that Johnny Chu was still the chef, so I emailed him to ask him what was up with the food, only to find out that he is no longer there, which may explain the awful food.  After having eaten here seven or more times, I won't be back.
