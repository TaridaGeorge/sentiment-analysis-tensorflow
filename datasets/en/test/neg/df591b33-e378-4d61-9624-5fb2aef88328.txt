2bmod was one of the stores I visited on my journey to find the perfect sofa. The place is a bit difficult to find, so be prepared to get lost a few times. When I got there, I had my mind set on a particular sofa. The gentleman working there showed me a few swatches and then suddenly went in the back to take a phone call--and never came back! Two other people came in and we all waited. After about 15 minutes they finally left and so did I. I still love their furniture, but I won't be buying it anytime soon. It's too bad their customer service was off that day.
