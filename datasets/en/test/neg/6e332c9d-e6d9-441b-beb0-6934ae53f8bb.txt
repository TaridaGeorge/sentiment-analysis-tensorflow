i love mimi's cafe in california so we decided to have dinner at mimi's here while vacationing here in arizona. i had the worst experience! food came out wrong, my friend's entree had hair in it, i ordered triple fudge brownie and got the apple crumble for dessert. instead of the manager being nice and apologetic, he seemed like he didn't care.
