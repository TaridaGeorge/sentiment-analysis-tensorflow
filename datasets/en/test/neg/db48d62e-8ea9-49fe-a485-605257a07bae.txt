Dont ever go to this Famous Footwear! Ever!!!!  

I went in to return my shoes my mother got me for Christmas.  The "manager" could not figure out how to do an exchange so he decided to put the money on a gift card.  Which is fine, however when I go back to use the gift card there are no funds on the thing!  I got nowhere explaining this to the same "manager" I had before other than a snooty attitude as he walked off.
