Our friends got married in Phoenix, they reserved a block of rooms in this "resort".
We called and left a message to make a reservation, It took them couple of days to call us back to confirm it.

On arrival, check in took forever, there was one person to help 6 people around 7 pm.

This place looks like a resort on the outside, and on the inside " Motel 6" experience.

The maid did not come to our room the second day, so we had no coffe, no shower cap for my wife......

Checkout was 10 AM !!
