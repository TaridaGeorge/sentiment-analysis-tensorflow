I'm not gonna lie, the two sushi rolls I ordered for takeout were delicious.  They were "americanized sushi", but the fish was fresh and quality was apparent.

But the staff was rude to me from the start.  As soon as I mentioned I had a check-in offer for free edamame, I was made to feel l like a crazy coupon-clipping cat lady.  There was a 10 minute hold while the hostess "checked" if the check-in offer was valid.  When I arrived I was told to stand there because I had to speak with a manager about the check in offer I was using.  All in all, the free edamame was not worth the 20 minute hassle.
