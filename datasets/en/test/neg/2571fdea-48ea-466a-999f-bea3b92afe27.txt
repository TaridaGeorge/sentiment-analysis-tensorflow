Discrimination served. Sofia's likes locals only and makes sure you know you don't belong. We tried to stop on the way through town to eat lunch and were lucky to get any food at all. One of us didn't get any food, two of us got the wrong order served to us. It also took over an hour to get the little food we did get which only makes a long drive even longer. We won't bother again.
