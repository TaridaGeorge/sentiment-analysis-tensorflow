I am so disappointed!  I bought a Groupon for this bakery to buy a half dozen cupcakes for my family because I wanted to support a local business.  When I went in to use the Groupon, I was told I could not have the 1/2 dozen listed price, which would have been fine, except I was forced to spend more than $20 to use the deal!  I looked online and found nowhere that said this was a requirement.  I think this bakery needs to be a bit more honest with customers, and encourage staff to be kind, even to those using a Groupon.  The service was terrible!  I would not recommend this place to anyone.
