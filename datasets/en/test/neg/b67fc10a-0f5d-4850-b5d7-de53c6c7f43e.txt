This company has been more then useless over the years but and continue to keep up bad practices. Recently while on vacation, I received word from a friend that it looked like my cars were moved.So i come to learn that not only do they not forward the notice in the mail but that they are towing my cars to another side complex 4 times at the tune of 150.00. I was never contacted by phone, they never put notices on cars, door or mailbox a month before or i would have had them moved by someone. I don't know why my H.o.a. puts up with them they barely ever check on the complex or maintain anything. Please check their background before doing business with this company.
