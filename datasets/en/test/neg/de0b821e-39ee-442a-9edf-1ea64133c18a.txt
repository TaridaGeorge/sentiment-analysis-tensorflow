Last Tuesday we visited this restaurant with a group of friends very excited about having some amazing and healthy food. We had called them a week ahead to let them know it was going to be a big group. 

When we got there, they were not prepared for us. It took a very, very long time to even take the orders'; even though we had already discussed a special fixed price menu. 

It was a terrible experience; many left without eating; it was embarrassing. I will never go to this restaurant again. 

I wish I could leave negative stars.
