Very disappointed in the Yucca! Outside the entry door is a sign that states "Open at 6 AM".  Bullshit!!! My coworkers and I went there this morning and the bartender never showed up!!! We left at 6:30.  We night shift people deserve  a happy hour just like the day shift people.  This is not the first time we've waited in the parking lot past 6:00 AM for the day shift bartender.  I think the Yucca needs to hire someone that can  get their ass out of bed and open the bar for us night shift people. WTF!!!
We will be looking for another morning bar.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
