bad food (i actually got indigestion later that night and it didn't even TASTE good, if i'm getting a sour stomach, i at least want it to be well worth it) 
bad prices ($150.00, one mid-range wine you could buy for 20$ at Bevmo, 6 beers and 2 vodka martinis)
bad bartenders (we had to practically grovel to get any kind of service and her male sidekick wasn't any better) 
bad waiter (too busy to talk and chat, and the room was EMPTY) 
what more can i say???
