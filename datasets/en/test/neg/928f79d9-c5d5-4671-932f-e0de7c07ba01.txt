I am at Roka writing this review. Upon entering this restaurant, we were impressed by the decor, music, and door handles. We were on time (even a little early) and notified that they could seat us after a 30 minute wait. We took their offer to sit outside (February) with only a 5 minute wait. Once seated, we were brought empty water glasses, and waited 15 minutes for a server to bring menus. Food review to come shortly.
