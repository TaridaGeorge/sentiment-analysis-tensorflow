Love the pizza here, with that being said, I have been sitting in the dining area and have been waiting for my pizzas for over 45 minutes past the time they were supposed to be ready. Extremely disappointing.  Owner/manager was sitting out in the car and noticed my frustation but stayed aloof as his underperforming staff frustrated me to the point of this review.
