There are way to many amazing places to go to Bandera.  When calling in to make a reservation I was informed "they don't do that" when asked what their corkage fee was.  The place had a normal busy Saturday night crowd but it seemed there staff was not trained for that.  We had multiple servers where we had to ask for menu's, silverware, drinks & plates. At one point even stopping a cook.

The food was ehh and no I would not go back.  Because like I said before there are way to many amazing places in the valley to go here.
