Quite Possibly worst apartment complex in Scotsdale. This puts Scotsdale on map for being partially ghetto. The pool looks like a dirty mexican Jacuzzi and smells like one too. the showers work when they feel like and apartments look like a throwback from the 70's theme. I feel sorry for my lil brother who is forced to live here while his house is being constructed. stick in there brother its almost over. If you like crack heads, meth heads, and illecit drug use and possibly the fear of being raped everyday on way to your car by all means move in. If not stay away
