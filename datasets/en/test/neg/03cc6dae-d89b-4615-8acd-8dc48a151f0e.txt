I had been a customer for over 3 years at this UPS Store Location.  Customer in terms of holding a PMB (post Mail box) and shopping for odds and ends for shipping supplies.  After all my patronage I was late on a payment 1 week (because I was out of town) the owner charged me a late penalty fee.   Kept saying she has lots of customers and that she cant help me.  So I am taking my business elsewhere.  Keep your customers but not this one...
