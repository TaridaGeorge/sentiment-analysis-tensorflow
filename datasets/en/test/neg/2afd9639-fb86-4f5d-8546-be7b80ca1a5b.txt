I would not recommend Roy's to anyone. I first dined at the resturant in 2006 for my husband and I's 1st anniversary. The service was great, the food was delicious, and the mini-french rolls with butter were delectable.

In 2009, the experience was completely different. Edamame replaced their bread/butter. I am a Texan gal and love bread and butter with my filet mignon.  The service clearly went downhill; the waiter never refilled my champagne nor my husband's soft drink. There was no anniversary dessert offered like during our first visit. Overall the service no longer catered to the customers.

I did speak with management a week after our visit and he offered a free dinner. We never took him up on the offer because we frankly will never visit this restaurant again.  Save your money and go to Mastro's or Ruth's Chris.
