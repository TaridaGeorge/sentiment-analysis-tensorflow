It's amazing that they are stil running this place the way they do.  Even on a Saturday or Sunday in the heavy season, there are few patrons and the service is still unbelievably slow.  On our last attempt to have breakfast here, it took us 55 minutes to get served some eggs, bacon, and the usual.  Prices are pretty high, food quality is just middle of the road.

I suppose this is why the other restaurant in the area, Dillon's, is always packed while this one is empty.
