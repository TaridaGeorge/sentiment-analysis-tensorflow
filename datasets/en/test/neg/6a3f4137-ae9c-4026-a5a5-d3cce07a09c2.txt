Ripoff happy hour was very misleading only 2 bucks off.
Stinky  tacos at super expensive prices and watered margarita.
tab for 3 average tacos and a watered margarita $38    WTF!!!
waitress attidude terrible, not friendly at all. Small unatractive locale, too small and unapealling.  Your better off going to baja fresh a couple blocks away. Prediction this place has bad Karma and wont last long.
