Yeah, I have to agree, this place is consistently bad. Because I live so close to this location, I've gone here a few times, usually in the late evening, but I vow no more! The drive-thru is run by a bunch of rapping-gangsta teenagers who curse freely when they "mistakenly" leave their microphone on, come-on to you sexually when you drive up to pay, and serve you food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for too long. I've been served a salad with barely any toppings that are supposed to come with the salad, a burger that was room-temperature at best, and I always feel like I need a shower after conversing with the "slick-talkin' " drive-thru boy.
