They were suppose to open up at 7:30, went there early to try to get my oil change, Manager was having car trouble so on of the employees came over and said they wouldn't be open until around 8:15.  Called back around 8:10 and asked if they had time for an oil change, they said we are booked for until noon but you can come drop in but may take 2 hours for an oil change.  They give out this 17.99 coupon for oil change but then they either have you waiting for hours and then try to upsell you.  I can't stand midas.
