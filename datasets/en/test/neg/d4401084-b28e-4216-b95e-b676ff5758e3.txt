The 1 star is for the ambiance that looks trendy to appeal to a young American clientele. However the food is made for most American taste buds and truly does not taste like Thai at all ! It is a disaster !!!! If you are looking for true thai cuisine, I would not recommend this place at all. Very disappointing.
