The last time we went there was on Mother's day 2011. We had a surprise visit from a bug (Caterpillar looking thing) in our spicy octopus with noodle dish. Where the heck did it come from?! It was still crawling!!! I called the server over to show it to her and all the staff in the restaurant decided that instead of apologizing, they told us that we brought it in from outside. WTF. No way.
