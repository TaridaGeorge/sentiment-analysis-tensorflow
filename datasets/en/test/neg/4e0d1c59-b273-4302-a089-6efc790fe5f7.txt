I have played here about a dozen times in 2011. The reason for the 1 star rating is we played a tournament here on July 16, 2011 and the greens were 100% unplayable. I've played on great greens, good greens, ok greens, lousy greens and now unplayable greens. These things are 50% bare with no grass AT ALL. The other reasons for the 1 star are (1) They do not give any warning when making a tee time that the greens are bad, not to mention completely lost. (2) After warming up on the putting green, about 3 putts is all I could stomach, I asked the starter "Are the greens on the course like this?" He replied "they're a little bumpy". Come on guys get real, be honest with people. This course is not worth $10 right now...............
