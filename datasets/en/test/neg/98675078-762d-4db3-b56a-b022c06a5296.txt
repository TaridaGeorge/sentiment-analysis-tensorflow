Very unprofessional!! I met with PJ to design my wedding cake. I was not able to put down my deposit the day of the tasting which was not required and then she NEVER sent me the contract or any info on the cake we talked about. I tried contacting her and she never responded. I would NOT recommend this bakery to any bride!!!
