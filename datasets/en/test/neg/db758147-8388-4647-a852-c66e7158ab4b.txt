RUN!!!!! BED BUGS!!!!!!!!!

Clerk tried to tell me it was something else.... When I check into a hotel and pull up a blanket to find bugs in the bed... ones that strongly resemble bedbugs... kinda leads me to believe they are bedbugs! 

Lastly, this hotel, while it does look nice is in the GHETTTTTTTO!
