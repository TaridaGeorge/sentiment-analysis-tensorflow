Ann Taylor is usually the first store I head for at any mall....I don't think it's my favorite store anymore.

What is with the Ann Taylor Store & Ann Taylor Loft at this mall? The employees must have been taught to NOT acknowledge customers when they come in...not even a fake "hello". 

Wasn't even busy. I counted more employees than customers in the store. Maybe they should realize they are lucky to have a job BECAUSE of customers...

Sad. :(
