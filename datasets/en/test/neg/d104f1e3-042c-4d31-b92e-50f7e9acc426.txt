This restaurant was quite "phogettable." They give you iceberg lettuce to "wrap" with, the fried egg rolls ("cha gio") were just below mediocre, and the sauce on my grilled pork chop was painfully sweet (I could barely eat more than a few bites, eve after trying to rinse the sweet sauce off with fish sauce). We also found a hair in our food, which always sucks, and there was a fly buzzing in our faces the majority of our time there. The only aspect of the meal that was alright was their Thai iced tea. That was it. The prices were definitely too high and the food was generally bad.
