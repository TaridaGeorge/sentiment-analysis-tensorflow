They keep getting negative reviews filtered.  You can pay "Yelpers" to write these reviews just look at Craigslist, they hire them all the time for 20 bucks a review. This place is discussing, nobody goes there, the owners are greedy, and the waitress (they have like 1)  is outright ignorant.  I'm done checking on these reviews.  They have obviously paid people to say nice things about the place because nobody I know has anything good to say and have all boycotted the place for one reason or the other.  You are not getting accurate reviews here.  Why would I come back and check here?  My experience was that up-hauling.  Sure, go there have fun when you get a hair in your burger and the waitress yells at you about it.  Great place.
