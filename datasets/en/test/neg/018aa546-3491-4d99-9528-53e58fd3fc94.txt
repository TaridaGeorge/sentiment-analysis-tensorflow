We live 1.5 miles from this location. We thought, hey! let's get it delivered! 
Ha. Yeah right. They won't deliver to us... literally... it's less than 5 mins away!!!  WE are outside of their range.
Ridiculous. 
So we sent someone to go pick up. OK sure. Sandwiches were extremely bland...only white bread, no flavor, and they didn't put sprouts on any of the sandwiches we ordered. Can't fill a simple order. 
Best part was the chips. 
Will not order from them again, neither dine -in or delivery... cause yeah... they wont come to us, awesome... not. 
Don't waste your time or money.
