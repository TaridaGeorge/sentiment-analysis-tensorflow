Booo! 

I can't stand Sprint. Not to go all "Consumer Reports" on Yelp, but my report is that Sprint is an unethical, slimey, seething parasite to our society.

They "fine print" you to death, so that before you know it your once manageable phone bill now has ballooned beyond your most pessimistic expectations. 

They change phone plans, so that you can't switch up or down for anytime minutes without taking a serious hit. 

On top of that, they make you renew your contract for two years every time you need to adjust your plan. 

Nightmarish - that's the word I was reaching for.
