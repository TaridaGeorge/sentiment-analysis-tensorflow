This is a great place to go...  but only if you like being treated poorly by staff while they grossly overcharge you.

I like to support local business so I kept giving them chance after chance but I'm to the point where I prefer to order stuff from B&H or take the 1.5 hour drive down to Photoworks in Tucson rather than deal with them (and they're only 2 blocks from my home).
