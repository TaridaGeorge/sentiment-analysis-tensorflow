I have dined at WCG before and attempted to make plans for my group of friends and I to celebrate a birthday there. 

Unfortunately, WCG does not accomodate parties greater than 4. You will have to wait until tables become available as they will not even take a reservation for anything greater than party of 4. No, this isn't advertised on their website. Seriously...and in this economy? Really?

Keep this in mind as you all are preparing for your holiday celebrations and go somewhere where your business is appreciated.  I sent them a copy of the receipt from our party of 9's  dinner elsewhere to the corporate offices to let them know what they missed out on. I doubt they will care as Jillian, the hostess who answered the phone when I called about our reservation was completely unfettered  to lose our business. Absurd.
