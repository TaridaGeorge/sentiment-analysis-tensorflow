I wish I could post a review for the food, but sadly I never got a chance to try it. Several months ago, my fiance and I decided to have our rehearsal dinner here. We spoke with the manager and were told to simply call two weeks before the date, as the restaurant would not be busy. When we called at the agreed upon time, we were surprised/shocked to discover through the outgoing voicemail that the restaurant was closed for the summer. As instructed by the voicemail, we left a message but never received a return call. We were never given any indication that the restaurant would close for the summer. Luckily, Pinnacle Peak Patio was available and more than happy to accommodate our rehearsal dinner.
