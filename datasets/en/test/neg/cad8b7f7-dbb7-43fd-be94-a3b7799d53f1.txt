Very Americanized restaurant! Service was fine, but I didn't feel comfortable enjoying food. The spring rolls came out as a big disappointment to me, it was even smaller than my 2 fingers! I didn't order the Pho, but I came up with Papaya salad which was also a waste: too sour (too much lime juice) and not even tasty!

I'd prefer more authentic Vietnamese restaurant with decent prices! This probably is a suitable place for Americans, but I'm sorry, not for me! I'd prefer Pho All Seasons or Pho Ao Sen - much better!

Well, gotta try it at least once anyway!
