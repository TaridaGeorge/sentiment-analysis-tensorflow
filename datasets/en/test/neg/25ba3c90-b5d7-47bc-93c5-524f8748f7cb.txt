Almost doubling the price from less than a year ago and not giving us any extra benefits?  Dont think so.  You will go down faster than blockbuster if this is your service model.  Cancelling my membership before it renews at the end of this month.  I can buy a DVD for that price every month and increase my collection.  Redbox can hold me over in a pinch.  Should have learned from blockbuster.  Price gouging b/c you think you can is a big mistake.
