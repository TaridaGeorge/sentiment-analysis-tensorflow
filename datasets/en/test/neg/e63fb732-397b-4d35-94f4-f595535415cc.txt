I also had high hopes for this establishment.

I didn't even get to taste the food, because I was so irritated by the service.  Or rather should I say, I was bothering the bartender by sitting at her bar, patiently waiting for 10 minutes.  I wasn't even asked if I needed a menu, or a drink, nothing.

However, the menu looks delicious, inside is gorgeous, and with the right people making that place exciting, it could be another packed place on Central. 

This place has great potential and I was really excited to try it out and spread the word.  :/ Good luck Sochu.
