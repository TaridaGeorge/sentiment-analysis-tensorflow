I tried FOUR different massage therapists at Massage Envy on camelback , in Phoenix and was not happy with any of them !!! One lady talked so much and I don't mind that but she stops massaging when she talks. The very last try was a guy tonight and it was the worst yet !!! I told him to do my jaw , arms and shoulders and he did not do any thing I requested. And they advertise a ONE hour massage when it is truly just 40 minutes. I left there disappointed every time I went there .  Very discouraging and very disappointing !!! I wasted alot of money. I joined but I will not be going back there any more.   I will get my weekly massages elsewhere.
