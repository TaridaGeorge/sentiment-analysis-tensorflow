At  0540 on 09/01/2011 I was commuting to work at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport along I10 on my motorcycle when Mayflower cab # 531 come on an on ramp and cut me off and just about broadsided me.  The driver was talking on the telephone.  I contacted the company and they assured me that the driver would be reprimanded.
