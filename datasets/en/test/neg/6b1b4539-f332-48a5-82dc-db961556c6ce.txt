The good news? The $60 wine was awesome. The bad news? Happy hour prices were just ten feet away at the bar. For the unfortunate diner, not seated at the bar, the wine list could definitely use more reasonable price points for glasses and bottles.

While folks crave true value for the indulgent meals, Eddie's is serving up over salted scallops and greens plus $36 untrimmed rib eyes.  Cute paper menus are stained from previous diners. No bread or extras served at those prices but they will allow the bread plates to hang on the small table all night.

Folks would be more rewarded dining at the stiff competition in this neighborhood.
