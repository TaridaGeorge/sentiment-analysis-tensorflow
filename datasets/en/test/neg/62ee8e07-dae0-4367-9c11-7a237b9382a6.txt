just grabbed lunch there today. Had the all white meat Teriyaki bowl. It is dry and flavorless. Is it really chicken? Turkey or pigeon I think, well at least it's some bird flesh from what I can tell by looks. Sauce is flat and lacks flavor. No thrills about a bowl with a little rice and a large portion of meat. No garnish nothing. Brought it home and fed it to my dog. She enjoyed it. I want be returning and I'm disappointed that all of you think it's so great, the place doesn't even have atmosphere to like.
