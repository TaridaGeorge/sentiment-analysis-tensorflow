Alrighty... here we go.
This place has pretty decent food.  Its not terrible at all.  However, the place claims to be healthy and fresh... I have a fundamental problem with a place that uses styrofoam plates, styrofoam cups, styrofoam to-go containers and individually plastic wrapped forks and knives.

Do you know how much landfill that is per person?  

The food is okay, but there is nothing healthy or fresh about styrofoam.  

F-  

i wont be returning.
