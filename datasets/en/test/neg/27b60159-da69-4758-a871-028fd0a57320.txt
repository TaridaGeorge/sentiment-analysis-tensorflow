Really bad customer service. Grouchy employees.  We had a coupon for a discount on services and my husband had to argue with them in order for them to honor it.  I've been in a couple of times and the older man who works there acted as if he was doing me a tremendous favor by waiting on me. The lady who works there told me that the closest place to send FedEx was at Tatum and Shea.  Well there is a place right across the street on the  NW corner of 32 street and Shea called Ship and Post (they handle both FedEx and UPS).  My husband and I own our own business and we will be using Ship and Post from now on.  The fellow there is very friendly and efficient. Too bad UPS Store, we were using you for most of our business needs.
