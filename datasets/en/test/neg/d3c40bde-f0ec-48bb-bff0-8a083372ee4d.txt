i went there last friday night and it was the worst night club i have ever been to. very boring atmospher. and yes its true drinks are bar the whole staff is just clueless. the list goes on.

i am new to arizona to be honest with u and i am very disapointed with the night life here so far there is no big good clubs or well known dj's. i used to live in NYC and nightlife there is somthing u cant argue about.
