I had a craving for frozen yogurt and fresh fruit. I was desperate to satisfy this craving convincing myself that maybe this time I'll have a change of heart and actually like the frozen yogurt at Yogurtini. I got tart froyo and topped it off with strawberries,mangos, and pineapple. The fruit tasted like it was frozen. My sister got island coconut and added some toppings to it and it tasted okay. It was over $10 for the both of us. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you like over paying for crappy frozen yogurt.
