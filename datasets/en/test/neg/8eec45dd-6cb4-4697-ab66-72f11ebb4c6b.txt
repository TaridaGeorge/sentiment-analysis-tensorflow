Stay as far away from this place as possible.
I went here against my will, I am surprised that I am still alive. Family members suggested eating here  after going to the mall. Big HUGE mistake. I am not sure what was worse...the food or the employees. Both looked grossed as hell. I stuck to foods that temperature was not an issue...like pizza and bread. This place was filthy...everywhere, and the food was nasty looking.
