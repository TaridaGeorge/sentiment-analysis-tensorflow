Do not go here unless you don't really care if your nails look nice. Very inconsistent, rushed jobs. Every single time I've gone, I've had some reason to not go back. Today I went again and again inconsistently bad overall services from everyone in that place. Find somewhere else to go so you won't leave there every time, disappointed and irritated...like I do.
