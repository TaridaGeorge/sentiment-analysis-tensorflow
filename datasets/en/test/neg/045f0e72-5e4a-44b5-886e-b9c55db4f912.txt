This is the second time I've hit Churchhill's and it was a disappointment. The fish was warm at best, limp with the batter separating from the fish. 

I've been to the UK, and this is nothing like that.

The fries were ok, coleslaw was bland, and they really did not know how to pour a Guinness pint. I would not recommend this to any serious English food fan. (And there is good food in the uk!)
