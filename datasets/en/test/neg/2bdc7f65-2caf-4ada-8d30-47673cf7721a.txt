I have a similar story about Advanced Auto Service.

Went in for a routine oil change and came back with a repair order of over $3000 based on the steering. New rack and pinion, shocks, the works.

I politely declined and went to get a second estimate elsewhere. I didn't show this second autoshop the quote Advanced Auto gave me. He asked whether I was there because I've been quoted repairs, and showed him the quote. He laughed at it. My car needed none of the repairs I'd been quoted on.

He even guessed which auto shop had quoted me before I showed him it was from Advanced Auto Service on Warner street. So my advice is be careful.
