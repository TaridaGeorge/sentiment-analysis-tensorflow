This place had a lot of hype...one of the best rated restaurants in town. We were extremely disappointed. The service was terrible, we sat for about 15 minutes before we even had a menu and were asked if we wanted a drink. When we did finally get the menus we were extremely disappointed with what was supposed to be an extensive wine list. The wine list turned out to be rather weak with a small selection from each region - even France wasn't well represented. 

After another 15 minutes of waiting without any contact from the non existent server we walked out...and walked down the road to Chelseas...which was solid.
