My wife and I went in to this store to purchase a iPhone protector screen and wanted to check and see if she was eligible for an upgrade.  We were greeted by the staff, but each were helping others.  After about 20 minutes 3 additional people showed up and were promptly assisted while we still haven't been helped.  We only needed 3-4 minutes of the staff's time, but never received the attention.  Finally after 20 minutes we just left.  Very disappointed.
