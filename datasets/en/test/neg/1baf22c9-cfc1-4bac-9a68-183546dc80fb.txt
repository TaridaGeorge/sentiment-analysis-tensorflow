The atmosphere is extremely nice. However the service was terrible. 
Had to hunt My server down and eventually asked for the manager.
I enjoy the Old Spaghetti Factory nationwide, just not this ONE.
The one in Phoenix is way better! With better service! Larger portions, and better "old italian" style atmosphere.
