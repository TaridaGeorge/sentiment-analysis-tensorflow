I really wanted to like this place. It had decent Yelp reviews and the employees were Vietnamese. The waiters were surly just as I hoped so I thought it would be authentic. 

The food was expensive, bland, and questionable. I ordered beef curry and I'm positive they tried passing off pork as beef. The curry broth was water and lacked spice or depth. 

I also ordered stir fried pho i.e. chow fun, but when it came out it was more like stir fried bean sprouts. The dish was 40% bean sprouts and 60% noodles. The shrimp was overcooked and extremely tough.

If you're White and still call Asian food Oriental you might enjoy this place.
