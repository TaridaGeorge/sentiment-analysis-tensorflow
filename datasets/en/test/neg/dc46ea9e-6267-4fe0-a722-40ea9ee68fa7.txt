I'm being nice by giving this place one star. Both dishes my table ordered were flavorless, two toned, mediocre breakfast dishes.  The layout of the restaurant is crammed and uninviting.  I was trying to eat while an awkward tween chewed in my ear as she stared at the television beyond me.  I don't plan on going back or recommending this place, ever.
