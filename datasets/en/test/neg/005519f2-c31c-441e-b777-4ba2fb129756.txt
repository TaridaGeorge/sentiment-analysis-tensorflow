2 things:

1) Ive had better sandwiches at Subway. Their bread is stale, meat is dry, and if you get a sandwich "Mike's way" they *smother* it in oil and vinegar.

2) There were ants all over the drink counter and IN THE NOZZLES. My husband pushed the button for Sprite and got Sprite w/ a power boost of live ants in his glass.

Dirty place, bad food.
