Why offer reservations if you can't seat a party within 30 minutes of their reservation time?  At least the group that complained ahead of us was offered drinks.  All we got was, "Are you sure?  It shouldn't be but another 5 or so minutes."  (We had offered to sit outside, and there were a LOT of empty tables outside..shorthanded on a Saturday night?)  

Fortunately, Inca's Peruvian restaurant in the same center saved the day (love the Lomo Saltado!)
