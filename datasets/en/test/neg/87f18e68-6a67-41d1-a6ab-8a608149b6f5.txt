EEEW NO! THIS PLACE IS SUPER, MEGA TACKY! WAY GHETTO! When My son was younger (6) he asked me to take him there, I did! And OMG we both hated it! And we tried it a second time when my girlfriend had a bday party for her son and It was just horrible. The people that go there are all shady looking, I'd say a dangerous crown. This place is NO FUN! And It's a scary crowd. yukky!
