What ever happen to customer service?  It seems that this term and banking (at least with Chase) are not allowed to exist within their walls  I had a deposit eaten by the ATM on Sunday march 4 and today Tuesday the Acting manager and CSR told me they only count the machine once a week on Thursdays. Kinda makes you scratch your head and go hummmm What else can I say?
