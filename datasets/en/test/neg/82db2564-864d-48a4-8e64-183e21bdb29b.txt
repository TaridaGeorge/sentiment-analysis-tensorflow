I stopped in here for the first time today since they carry my cat's brand of food (Spot's Stew) and I didn't want to have to trek out of my way to the health food store.  I walked by the animal enclosures, and ALL of the birds were sitting around in cages with no toys, silent and depressed.  Most of them were fluffed up and I even saw a cockatiel shivering slightly.  

While most of the fish tanks looked fairly clean, there was a large tank with cloudy water and I could see some sort of tropical fish still in there.  I feel sorry for the poor animals and certainly won't be visiting this store ever again.
