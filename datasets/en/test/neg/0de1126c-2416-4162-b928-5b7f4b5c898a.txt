Crap.
Horrible.
Horrible crap. Tempura was a joke. Don't even think they knew what that was supposed to taste like.
Sushi? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Can I have my money back? Please? Because this is false advertising. 

This is not a sushi restaurant. This is a cafe of confusion, with linens to help overstate the food, waiters who think they're hipper than hell because they simply work here, and service that's nearly non-existent. 

And by the way, may I just note for the record that real maki-zushi (sushi rolls) are not dipped in corn syrupy sauce or drizzled in a thousand colors and sprinklings and called "Fireburst from Hell" or "Sunset over the Dragon from Texas" or some crap like that. This isn't Zen's fault necessarily, although they perpetuate the myth. I can't blame them however. They don't really know what Japanese food is anyway.
