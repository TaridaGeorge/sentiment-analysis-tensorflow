Alex, the manager, was SO rude to us last night. His attitude was so hateful, our whole group of 15 got up and walked out, before evening being seated. Not quite how we imagined our friends 21st birthday. What's really awful is that our group of 15 to 20 people gather there three times a month for dinner, which was mentioned. Obviously this guy doesn't care for our business. We won't be back, as this guy seems to enjoy picking fights and arguing with customers.
WORST MANAGEMENT EVER!
