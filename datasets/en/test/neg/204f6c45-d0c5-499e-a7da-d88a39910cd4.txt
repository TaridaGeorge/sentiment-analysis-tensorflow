I appreciate your input in the matter, but as you didn't see what took place in the room between me and the doctor, you have no idea what actually transpired between me and her.  I said my cat was pu/pd and vomiting, and therefore was concerned about diabetes.  Do not assume to know my certainty about anything;  I just wanted answers. 
Also, I called all vet clinics within 10 miles of my home and you are the only clinic that will perform a full panel in-house.  
Finally, I was lied to by the technician about how many times they poked my cat, so thank you for admitting that they couldn't get blood on him first try.  My cat tried to "scrunch his neck"... this makes him uncooperative???  Where I come from, the industry standard isn't anymore than a single poke.
