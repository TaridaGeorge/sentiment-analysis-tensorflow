Oh, I really didn't care for District.

First, the service was abysmal.  Not just at my table, but all over the restaurant.  We could see the people at the tables around us getting just as exasperated as we were.  The bad service was particularly confusing since the restaurant was almost empty.  

Second, the food was quite bad.  We ordered small plates and a dessert, and none of it was good.  The sweet potato tots (which sounded awesome) were mealy.  The brownie in the sundae was hard as a brick and tasted much like one.  Even I can make a good brownie.  

I was so disappointed.  It would be great to have another good restaurant downtown.  This is not it.
