Came for a carwash, got harassed for windshield replacement by two separate employees who were relentless.. I had to walk away after saying no thanks numerous times just to get away. Then they didn't even bother to say the carwash was broken while I paid, they just washed my car w/ a hose and some brushes after paying for the "ultimate" wash.

I've had the employees at other carwashes talk about windshield replacement- its pretty normal, usually a no thanks is all that's needed.. this place was so aggressive about it I will choose to get my car washed elsewhere just b/c of this.
