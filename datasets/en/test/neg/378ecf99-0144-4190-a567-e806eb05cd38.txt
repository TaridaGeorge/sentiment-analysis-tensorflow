:( :( This place has changed a lot! It used to be a classy sophisticated old town wine bar where customers were treated with respect. Our last experience at Kazimierz was the worst ever. My husband and I took a couple of friends there on a Saturday night.  The place was so loud that it was impossible to talk. We decided to switch to a quieter table.  Our female waiter was upset that we moved, I could tell by her attitude. To make story short, we were kicked out of the place because we complained about the waiter. The manager said "they stand by their waiters" The manager (Tony) said he would back her waiter up even though it was only her 3rd day working there.  We will never be back.
