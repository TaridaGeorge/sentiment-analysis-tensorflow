Let's just say that it's a pretty cool place that based on service won't be open long. We stopped in for MNF and had to beg to be served! Then they took the meal order for my girl friend, but didn't take mine. One meal came out and they finally put 2 and 2 together and figured out what happened.

Next, we had to actually reach over the front of the bar to get silverware. Most restaurants automatically give those to you.

Next, the ice in the drinks is so small, you have to use a straw, whether you want to or not. 

Can't rate their food becasue they never asked if I wanted to order but the service was awful and I won't be back.
