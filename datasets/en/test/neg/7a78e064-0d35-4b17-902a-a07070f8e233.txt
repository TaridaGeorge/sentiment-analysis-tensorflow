This is closed, sadly.  Chef Ford had a really great little place here with a unique menu, and a nice atmosphere.  The chatter about the close has nothing to do with the level of business, rather financing issues.   The place that replaced it (Meridian) is also now closed.  I think they set a record of being open a month.  chatter on that one was legal troubles.
