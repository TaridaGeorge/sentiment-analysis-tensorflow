Joined on a groupon, went once and never went back.  Gym equipment was so old it brought back memories of the 70s.  
Tennis courts filled with rug rats and people who did not want to give way to anyone else wanting to hit.  Heated pool, big deal can crash a local resort hotel for that.  My expectations were not met, very disappointed.
