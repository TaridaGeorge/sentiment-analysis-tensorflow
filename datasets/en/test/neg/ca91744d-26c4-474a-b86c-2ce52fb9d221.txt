We have stayed here over 20 times in the past 12 years - grounds are beautiful - rooms, decor OLD!  Rude check in Sun eve - first time we had to pay additional $ to stay in a unit away from the parking lot - $25 to stay near pool and $10 to stay with view other than autos :(.   No newspaper delivered at the door now as we are not elite guests - silverware drawer has coffee grounds, frig door dirty - the daily clean rooms are nice - the real workers are sweet, helpful and respectful but the overall cleanliness does nit rate any grade - next visit will NOT be here but I'll miss walking the Vineyard Rd, the canal, Summers Fruit Basket on baseline and the Farm - a must visit for lunch!!!!
