So disappointing! Went to the tasting menu they had back around x-mas and it was bad! The chef started the meal announcing to everyone that they had changed the menu three times before preparing it for that night, believe me it showed! It just seemed so amateur and thrown together at the last minute.  Could've been so much better.  I had been in before and had some of their regular menu items, this just really assured that I will not be back.
