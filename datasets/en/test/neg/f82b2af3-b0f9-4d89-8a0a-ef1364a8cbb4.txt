That old bar smell.

This goes way beyond dive bar.  I commented to my friend about the couple on barstools, 'those two are "leaving las vegas'!"   

Does any establishment need 40 taped up signs warning the would-be patron of their rules:  "NO CREDIT CARDS" --and someone wrote by hand, 'EVER'.  and "NO GUNS" and multiple "NO SMOKING" 

I ate the burger and I lived, though the meat tasted old I figured it was soooooo overly cooked that I probably was safe.

...Jesus!  I just read the review about them having cooler "problems".
