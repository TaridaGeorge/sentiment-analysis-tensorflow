This place is so shady. I was there for three hours, worked with management, and spent over $400.  I was told that I had to switch my plan during my upgrade from unlimited data to limited.  While this is true, the manager told me that I use 5-6 gig/month, so I went with the plan he suggested.  Later after speaking with customer service on the phone, she told me that I have never gone over 2 gig and adjusted my plan accordingly.  The sleazeball at the store further disclosed multiple hidden fees at the register, rather than being honest from the beginning.   

I am seriously questioning leaving Verizon after 12 years due to this experience.
