Animal cruelty?

How do you keep our national bird in 117 degree heat. 

Yes, our beloved national birds on the ground, beaks open, literally gasping for air. Their cage was tiny. They aren't canaries. 

I'm not PETA but this is animal cruelty and this is just plain un-American. Also, it wasn't just the bald eagles that were in pain; there were plenty of animals suffering under the heat. 

If you care for animals even in the slightest bit, do not go to this zoo and take action. I am and will continue to do so.
