Unreliable.  They don't deliver urgent documents, test results and referrals in a timely manner.  Never before have I seen a doctor's office have to be nagged like these people need to be nagged to get their jobs done.

Unprofessional.  In the face of another doctor's prescription for thyroid or allergy medicine that clearly works, they'll refuse to renew those prescriptions based on their personal belief systems.  Even if such refusal puts the patient at risk.

Shysters.  Over the course of a two year relationship with these people, they will push thousands of dollars of unnecessary herbs and supplements on you.

Do your research carefully before relying on these people to better your health.  There may be some good eggs there, but it appears much of the basket is rotten.
