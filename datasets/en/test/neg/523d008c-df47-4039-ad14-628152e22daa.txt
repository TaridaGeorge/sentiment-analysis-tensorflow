Quite honestly, I'm surprised by the numerous positive reviews about serranos. I went here with my brother and we were cut off after 2 margaritas. We were far from drunk because there is zero tequila in their margs and they just taste like sweet and sour. After being so insulted, we asked for the check. P.s., those that comment on their great salsa...must really like ketchup, because that's all it is. When I asked them for something hotter, they offered Tabasco?! Louisiana hotsauce at an "authentic" Mexican food place? Comon. This place is over priced garnage and they hire illegals to work the kitchen and serve their patrons
