Ordered a half Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini with no sauce.  Was really excited about the baby spinach on it.  A whole panini was delivered to my table, first mistake.  The bread was so soggy inside, I could only stomach half before it just tasted like baby food.  There was a piece of artichoke heart about the size of a dime on the whole sandwich - win?  There wasn't a single leaf of spinach to be found.  The only thing they got right was the part about leaving off the sauce.

Stick to cookies and other baked goods, PB!  It's what you're good at.  Leave the specialty sandwiches to real sandwich shops.
