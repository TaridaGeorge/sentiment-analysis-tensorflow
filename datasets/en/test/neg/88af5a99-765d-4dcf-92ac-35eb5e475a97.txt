RUN AWAY FROM DOING BUSINESS HERE! I'll start by saying I never write reviews but felt the need to post my experience for other future consumers.  I brought in a set of high-end dress shirts and when picking them up two had STAINS THAT WERE NOT THERE BEFORE!!!  It took the owner a week to call me back and he said they would attempt to fix the stains.  I picked them up the next day and there were two more stains on each shirt!!!!  I asked the owner how he suggest we fix this situation.  HE SAID, "MY MACHINES DID NOT DO THIS!!"  He argued with me and refused to do anything for two $70 dress shirts of mine.  DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THIS DRY CLEANER.
