Well me and my friend from work tried this place out, and others we talked to gave rave reviews.  Both of us though walked away and were not impressed with the food at all.  The only thing that we both liked were the sweet potatoes.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak and it was very salty then after a few bites was very very soggy and gelatinous.  I will not be coming back.
