The staff bait and switched me on the apartment they showed vs. the one that was available for move-in. Was told the mgr would contact me, then lied about it pretending they didn't know what I was talking about when I brought it up. Was involved in too much else so dropped the issue, but am paying the refurnished price or a non-refurbished unit. In addition, though their online work ticket submission form allows a "do not enter" option they ignore it and will walk in on you. Lots of kids here but are pretty well behaved. A few adults like to have skanky screaming matches in the wee hours.
