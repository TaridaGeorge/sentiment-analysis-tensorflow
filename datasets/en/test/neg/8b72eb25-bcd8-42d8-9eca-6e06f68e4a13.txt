Dirty.

So dirty.

Hair in the french fries dirty.

Cook sitting on the counter dirty.  

Undercoooked hamburger meat, and the server's fingers in my food dirty.

Flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty.

Somehow these guys think that if you wear gloves you are spared from all contamination.  As if scratching your ass with your gloves on will keep the ass germs from getting in your food.  

I've been there before, and have tried to look past all these things, when eating such delicious food, but really, it's not worth it anymore.
