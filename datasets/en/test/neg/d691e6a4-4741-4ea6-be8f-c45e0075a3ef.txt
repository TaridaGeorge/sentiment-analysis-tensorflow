Good food is one thing, but when it takes 25 min to order it in the first place and another 20 to get it I don't care how good it is. At that point I'm never coming back. Add to that the loudmouthed waitress bantering with one of the cooks about the "dirty Mexican girls" he's brought in there (its a small place and she yelled it from across the room) its safe to say I'll never step foot in there again. The service and the staff were inexcusable, offensive, and they managed to be racists while they were at it.
