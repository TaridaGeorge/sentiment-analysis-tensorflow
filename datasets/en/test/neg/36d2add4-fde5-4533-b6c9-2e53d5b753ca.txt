Typically, I've enjoyed this restaurant.  However, DO NOT order anything to go.  I picked up two turkey and feta salads to take back to the office for myself and my BFF, and nicely hidden underneath a mound of feta and turkey cubes is the slimiest, grossest salad greens . . . totally disgusted.  Will NOT be returning for more of this.
