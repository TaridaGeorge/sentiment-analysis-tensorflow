Mother's day wrecked.  Thanks Rico's.  I called ahead, asked of outdoor seating in the shade, mentioned that I need two booster seats. Well.... They sat us in the sun, had one booster seat and had to send out to another restaurant for another... That one arrived and had broken supports.  The manager could not be bothered, and the manager above her was a boring guy who did not seem to care.  It was so bad that our server cried at the table.  I am not kidding.

The bar is where I usually go, and well.... They don't mess up beer.
