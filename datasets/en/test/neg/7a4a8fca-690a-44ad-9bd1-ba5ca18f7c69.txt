We went to this place for their advertised happy hour, which was stated on the internet as well as a banner out front that it was 4-7pm.  We got there at 6:10pm, sat in the bar.  The waitress walked right past our table, no greeting.  The bartender, no greeting.  After sitting there 15 minutes the bartender came by, again no real greeting.  Handed us menus.  I verified happy hour and he stated 'no that ends at 6'.  I told him about the sign, he shrugged it off and just said 'no, it ends at 6'.  Seriously?  I would never spend my money at a place that doesn't greet you and does not address their false advertising.  Amazing this place stays in business!!
