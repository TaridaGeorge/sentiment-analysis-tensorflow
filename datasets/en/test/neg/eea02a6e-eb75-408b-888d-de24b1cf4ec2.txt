Since they are "on the clock" and getting paid, YOUR time doesn't matter!  I don't care if you're buying a greeting card or having a prescription filled - you will have to wait, and wait, and wait!  If you need to practice patience, start somewhere else.  This place is like the Stanley Cup without benefit of a stick!
