Went to the movie early Saturday evening, but ate beforehand. I wish I had waited to eat at the theatre concession stand. I know I would have gotten tastier food for the money. I ordered the Carne Asada...it was bland  and as tough as shoe leather. I told the waitress and she said, "oh, ok". I foolishly expected a manager to approach the table, but that didn't happen. When she brought the bill, I had been charged $14, essentially for rice and refried beans because the carne asada was barely touched. I also drank 2 margaritas during their happy hour...didn't even catch a buzz and I am a lightweight when it comes to alcohol. I did get heartburn, though. My first trip to this place will be my last! Why didn't I check Yelp first????
