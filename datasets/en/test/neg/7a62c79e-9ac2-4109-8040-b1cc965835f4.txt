RUN AWAY!  The food is disgustingly un-fresh. Their pizza tastes like it was removed from a can and baked in an oven spattered with old vomit.  

Upon further inspection beneath the cheese of my tomato covered pancake I noticed all the ingredients were in fact canned water-logged pieces of grossness from the 1960's

dominoes is better, save a Buck an get a red Barron from the grocery store. Do not eat here!!!

You have been warned.
