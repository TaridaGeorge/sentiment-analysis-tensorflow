I'll start with the positive, since there isn't much to type! The murals on the wall are great--the beach and the beach at sunset!
Now for the negative...upon first walking in, they didn't even say hi. Just "what do you want?" During the pedicure, I was in and out within 25 minutes, there was no conversation, no eye contact, no nothin! Now, this is supposed to be a relazing experience, and it was anything but. So a $15 pedicure became a totally crappy experience. 
Upon checkout, they add an extra buck if you use debit/credit. I walked away thinking I shouldn't have tipped her anything, which is rare! Definitely won't be going back!
