If you really are on a tight budget... Really I wish I would have paid $40 more per night then to come here. The pool was closed..fitness rooms a/c didn't work. And pretty much the a/c in our room didn't work very well. We had to run it non-stop. I am very disappointed at this place. Oh and the continental breakfast... fruit was rotten. The floors where filthy and I don't think they ever wiped anything down..ever! The employees are very nice but you would think they would notice the filth?!?!?!?! Its one thing to have an old building but dayum you can clean right?????
