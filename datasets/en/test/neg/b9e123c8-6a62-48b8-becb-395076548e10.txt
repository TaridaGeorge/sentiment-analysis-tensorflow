Horrible food. Expensive. Bad service which is surprising since there's 100 servers milling around. Our order was simple - appetizer platter and side of fries. Fries came out with someone else's order which they tried to give us. They left the fries and 20 minutes later the rest of our order showed up. I hate this place which is too bad because I like the idea of it and the potential. But it always disappoints.
