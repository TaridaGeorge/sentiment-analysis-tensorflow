It's not my fault your order takers don't understand your delivery area and for you to send me back the same cold pizza and warm salad shows how fucked up your organization is. And then after being two hours late being asked to sign off on the charge? Really your organization can go to hell and I am contesting the charge with AMEX! RI DAMN DI CULOUS!
