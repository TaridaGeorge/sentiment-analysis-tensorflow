I am a frequent Subway patron, but I will not patron this franchise again.

I am also a supporter of our local High School sports teams. When I presented a discount card from Boulder Creek HS, the manager REFUSED to honor the card.

Please do not support this Subway franchise as they do not support our schools and sports teams.
