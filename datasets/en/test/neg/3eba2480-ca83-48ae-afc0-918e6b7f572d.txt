This Yogurtology location is apparently owned by someone who does not understand the concept of meeting customer demands.  They have had the same dairy-free flavor for months on end.  I keep getting suckered into going in there with friends and I am always disappointed.  The one dairy free flavor they carry, isn't good!  I have asked for a new flavor and told them they would get more dairy allergy business if they were to carry more/ better options, but the last time I was in there I was informed that the owner's favorite dairy-free flavor is the one they always carry and he refuses to change it.  Hope he likes that flavor more than he likes my business.  Especially now that there is a Nami in downtown, I will certainly not be making the decision to go to Yogurtology ever again!
