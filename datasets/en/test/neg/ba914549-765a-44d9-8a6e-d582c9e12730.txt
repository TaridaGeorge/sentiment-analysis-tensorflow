Dirty place with horrible food.  Two steps below frozen ... Went on a Saturday night and you just look around and you see the slop everywhere.  The floors are dirty, the restrooms are dirty and the tables are dirty.  The food is terrible.  I called over our ditzy server and asked her to take my wife's meal off the bill.  The margerita was served in a plastic cup that looked like something you would find at a roadside eatery in the 1970's ... Just very poor in every respect ... Try Manual's over by the 101 in Scottsdale for really nice Mexican food.
