Bad reservation policy. Sunday night 5:30 pm, 9 of 11 guests were present with 2 guests in route; but the hostess, citing company policy, would not even take our name down for seating half an hour later as "all if our party was not present". When the rest of our party joined us at 6:00 pm, we were quoted a one hour wait. Grimaldi just lost the business of big spenders and big tippers, including a restaurant GM who lives and works in the area. To quote Pretty Woman, "Big mistake!" BJs Brewery, here we come.
