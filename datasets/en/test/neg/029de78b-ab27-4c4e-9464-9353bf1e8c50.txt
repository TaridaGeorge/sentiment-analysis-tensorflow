I can sum chuck box up in one word, crap. I have been a few times, mostly because everyone keeps telling me it is amazing, so I keep trying it over and over again to see if I am missing something. Nope. It is still garbage. I would honestly rather go to in n out (in n out isn't something to write home about either, but that just proves my point)
