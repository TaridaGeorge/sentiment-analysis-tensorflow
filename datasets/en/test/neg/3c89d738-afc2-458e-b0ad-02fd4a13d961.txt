DIRT PIT.  If I could give them a zero I would.  Thanks to them I'm fighting a moth infestation in my house.  Their dog food is all contaminated...especially Pro Plan.  I contacted them about it and barely heard a peep from them.  Tried them again on a follow-up visit and the moth infestation was worse.  Even upon returning contaminated dog food I was getting swarmed with moths.  TERRIBLE.  Stay away until they do something about this place.
