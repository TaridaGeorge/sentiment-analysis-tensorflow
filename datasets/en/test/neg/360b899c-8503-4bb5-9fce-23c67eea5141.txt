Ok so I was so hopeful that a fast fresh real Mexican  restaurant would open so we wouldn't have to drive to Popo's (the best) but after running in for a quick bite with my daughter boy was I disappointed. She got the pork burrito and it was bland, she added some of the medium salsa to it & it wasn't awful. I ordered Enchiladas & taco both of them were almost undeniable! I got one enchilada with green sauce & it tasted like it was straight from the can & the red sauce was ketchup & cumin base, total disappointment! The barbicoa meat was dry with no flavor! The only thing that was ok was the free chips & the medium salsa, the greenish one, the other salsa's were thick & bland. Hope this helps & that you have a different experience!
