1 Word. Yucky.

I guess I have "high standards" being from New York, but between the pizza and the grossly overpriced, watery sauced, rubbery "Chicken Parmigiana", I don't think I'll be making a return visit to this place.

Mediocre service. I've had much better, and in a climate with such fierce competition for the consumer's dollar - I think they should try harder.
