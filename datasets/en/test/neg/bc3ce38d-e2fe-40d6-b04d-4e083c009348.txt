I was out with the boyfriend for First Friday, and was desiring something cool, sweet, and creamy. My first thought is always Gelato. We were strolling, and came across Chill Out. When we walked in, it seemed clean, and the purveyors were quiet, yet smiling and friendly. 

I ordered a large Lemon. The price wasn't terrible, but the flavor bordered on it. The consistency was like that of Gelato that had gone through a few thaw-freeze cycles, and was gummy. The texture was really gross because of this, and the flavor was pretty bland. I've had better Gelato out of the freezer aisle at my local grocery. I wouldn't drive out of my way, or even stop in when walking by, to eat this Gelato.
