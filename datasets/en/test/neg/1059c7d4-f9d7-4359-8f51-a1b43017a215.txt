I have been to the Hoosier Cafe twice. The first time I went it wasn't bad. However, the last time my husband and I went it was horrible. We both ordered buscuits and gravy and coffee. We both were so disappointed with our meals we sent them back. We never do this, but it was unedible! The gravy had no flavor and tasted like jellied milk. The coffee was also quite horrible, it tasted like dirty water. I then ordered blueberry pancakes and my husband ordered blueberry waffles. I really should have sent these back as well. The blueberries tasted rotten. Needless to see we will NEVER be returning here and wasting our money again!
