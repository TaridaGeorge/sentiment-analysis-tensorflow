pizza was great but the worst customer service ever. We waited 2 hours for a pizza when the server told us the staff lost our order, that was fine but then 1 hour later we finally got our pizza with no apologies from wait staff or offer of free app or anything. I asked if we talk to the manger and her came over and said were busy what do you want from this. Still no offer apologies just rude behavior
