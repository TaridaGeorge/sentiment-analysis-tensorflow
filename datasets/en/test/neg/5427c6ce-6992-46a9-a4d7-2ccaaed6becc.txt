Don't see what all the fuss is about. I have had better Chinese food after I nuked a frozen selection in the microwave. As for the Mongolian BBQ - small selection, can't make your own sauce, and still bland. If you eat supermarket sushi, then this is the place for you. If you like fresh sushi, then leave immediately. I can sum up my review in one word, NASTY!!!
