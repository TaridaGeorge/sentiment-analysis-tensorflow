We went to the Shimogamo for the first time on Friday night.  A dour man who appeared to be the manager approached us and said "We have no more space."  Not a greeting, not offer of a wait time, not anything but "no more space".

We left without having an food because we were definitely not welcome; more of an inconvenience the manager.
