City North is now in foreclosure, with the trustee's sale set for end of March. This entire project is a complete disaster. The place is like a ghost town...I have seen more action at a gas station in Yuma.

There are practically zero retail stores, and the best of the bunch is Press Coffee. Best coffee in this part of town.

City North has become the poster child for Phoenix's implosion of debt fueled drunken consumption.
