I went there after work for dinner and I was the only customer (red flag, I should've taken a clue from the empty parking lot). After trying out several pho joints in Phoenix, this place does not rank anywhere at all, sorry! The soup was sweet and the BBQ spring rolls were small, thin, and tasteless. I can't help but compare this place to Da Vang, 3 miles down the road. That place is constantly busy, and when you see alot of Asians eat there, you know the food is good and authentic.
