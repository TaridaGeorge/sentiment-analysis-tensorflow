Disgusting!!! We just decided to pull over and rest for the night after an exhausting long trek from Mid Texas. Our room smells of stale cigarettes and dog. There are left over dirty towels in the bathroom from whomever stayed here before us. There's, what seems to be, mold on the shower walls, and now I'm fearing for my life laying on this bed wondering when they cleaned it last. I am so uncomfortable and disgusted I want to scream, but I'm too exhausted to go and complain. Besides, I highly doubt they have anything better. I'm assuming if they let one hotel room look, and smell, this bad then why would they care about any other room. Bottom note: STAYING AT LA QUINTA IS LIKE STAYING IN A CRACK MOTEL!
