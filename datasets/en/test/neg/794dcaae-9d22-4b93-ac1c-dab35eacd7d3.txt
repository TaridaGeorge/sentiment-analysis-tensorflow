TERRIBLE customer service. They are so rude. Btw, the place is also a huge dump. I don't know how the food is because after I asked for two slices of pepperoni and they (in the most condescending and rude way possible) said that they don't serve pepperoni, gave me dirty looks, and told me it would take 20 minutes to make two slices, I left. They aren't getting my money! If a place is Kosher, that's one thing. But if a place is vegetarian, it should say VEGETARIAN in large, friendly letters on the sign. It doesn't. And, I should not be treated rudely for ordering pepperoni at a place called MANHATTAN pizza. Zero out of five.
