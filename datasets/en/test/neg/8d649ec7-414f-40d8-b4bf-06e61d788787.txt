The good was prompt seating and the chicken fried steak was really good.  Eggs where room temperature, waiter never checked in for us to tell him, and overall service was poor. Tall lanky guy with the shaved head didn't seem to care. I had to get up to find him for the check. After all the good reviews I was expecting average service. We were thinking of going back again, but no chance now. One of the few times I didn't leave a tip.
