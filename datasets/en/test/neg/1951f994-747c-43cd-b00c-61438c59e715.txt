Fry's Signature is a total scam!  They are proud to boast they sell only 100% Choice USDA Beef, but it is some of the worst meat I have ever tasted.  Think Walmart meat, with Whole Foods pricing.

I have voiced concerns over service and poor quality and "got told to go fly a kite" more or less by upper level management.  Keep in mind, I wasn't trying to return anything or get any level of compensation, just an apology and that was apparently too much to ask.

The store is typically understaffed and the people that you can find are petulant at best.

Avoid this place at all cost.  Stock up on basics at Costco and get quality proteins and produce at AJ's.

Fry's Signature is proof that you indeed can polish a turd.
