Terrible customer experience. I walked in with my mini poodle to have him try some new foods because he is a picky eater. I was kicked out because he didn't have a leash. The guy said, "it's not my policy it's the owner's policy and I saw his driving around the store today so I have to enforce it". Let me get this straight.. the reason you are throwing out a potential BRAND NEW customer who buys a lot of stuff on a weekly basis is because your owner is driving around. I could fund this guy's paycheck with what I spend on pet supplies between my three dogs and two cats. 

Sorry, Bark Avenue, you lost a new customer before you had one.
