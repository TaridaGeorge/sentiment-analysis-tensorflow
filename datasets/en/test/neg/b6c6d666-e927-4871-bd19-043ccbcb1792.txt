I have to say that I'm really disappointed by Amore Sports Grill. My philosophy is if you put an item on your menu, then your patrons should have a reasonable expectation that the item will taste good.

I had the 3 meat calzone and it was so bad I only ate half of it. If you think about it, a calzone is like a deep dish pizza with a crust on it. I gave some to my wife, and she actually asked the server if this was frozen, lol. The server replied that it was made from scratch. So I'm not believing that the pizza tastes any better. And I'm pretty sure I won't return since the restroom smelled like they fired their cleaning crew a week ago.
