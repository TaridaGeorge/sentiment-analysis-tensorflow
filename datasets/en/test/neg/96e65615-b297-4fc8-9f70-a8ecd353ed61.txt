I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.

I had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless. 

For the price I would expect better food... much better food. 

Honestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks.
