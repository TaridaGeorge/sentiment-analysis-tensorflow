The server was over the top obnoxious.   He insisted on having our names just to take our order.  He was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive.  He pulled up a chair and chatted AT us on three different occasions.  When I ordered my food he insisted that I order something different.  When I finally got my food it was mediocre at best.  

The manager was also having a meeting with two new employees at a near by table, so we had to listen to all the Applebee's rules and regulations.  Let me tell you, there are a lot of them. The manager's list went on and on for our entire meal  Almost, every sentence started with "I can't" or  "You can't".  The manager made me hate this place even more.
