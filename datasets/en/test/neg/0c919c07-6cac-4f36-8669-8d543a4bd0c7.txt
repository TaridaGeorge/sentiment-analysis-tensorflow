I have been a loyal Lulu lemon customer until now! I have spent a lot of money in the Biltmore store. Recently I tried to return a sports that my boyfriend bought which  had the tag and receipt. Evidently! There is a 2 week return policy so god forbid they buy it for you 2 weeks before they give it to you and it doesn't fit cause you're screwed. I sent them an email explaining what happened and Cyndi sent me an email back that they are standing by their stupid policy and won't make it right.   Now I'm stuck with a 60.00 sports bra that doesn't fit. I don't understand their horrible concept of customer service. losing a customer over an exchange just doesn't make any sense. They obviously don't think long term. So Namaste to you LULU LEMON. YOU SUCK!!!
