Don't be fooled, the place looks nice on the outside and is decent on the inside but the staff and insect problem are absolutely horrible. I have lived here for 6 months and have seen a total of five scorpions inside my apartment and I live on the third floor. I've asked maintenance to come spray several times and there still seems to be a huge insect problem. There are always ants by the pool and even the occasional javelina will sneak up on you. I would never renew my lease at this disgusting place.
