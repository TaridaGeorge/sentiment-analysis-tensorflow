THIS PLACE IS A NIGHTMARE

Got there at 8:20 AM Saturday morning. There were no other cars in line. 20 minutes later they had not vacummed it. 30 minutes later they had yet to run it through the wash. 

There is no shortage of summer labor available. They are running a skeleton crew because they don't want to pay anyone. They prefer making the customer wait 45 minutes to an hour when they aren't busy. 

Management was unresponsive and rude.They lied and refused to tell me the identity of the owner. When challenged the manager resorted to profanity and told me I could leave. I was glad to do so once I demanded they return my money. Don't even think about going near this clip joint.
