Wish i had looked at this before i bought the groupon and went.  Did not even read this before we went so i was not biased.  We were seated pretty quick but took forever to get our order taken.  The appetizer was ok (fried ravioli)  I had the steak sliders.... think of a tiny piece of steak 1" x 1/2" x 11/2" on a pretty huge roll. There was no steak hardly.  Way way pricy for what you get.  Could have gotten more meat at Mcd's
