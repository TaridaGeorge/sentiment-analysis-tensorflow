I'd been to another chuy's in Phoenix - it wasn't bad.  This place was.  Is it open?  Barely?

Bland beans, lukewarm chicken fajitas, and our waitress dropped the food and ran.  The only good things were the grilled pepper and onion on the fajita - the chicken must have been cooked a few days back and kept warmish.

My cutie had the mahi tacos and the bland watery beans.  She said the mahi was ok, but I say they were very fishy tasting.  You know - old fish.

Went in on a gamble since I'd been to one before and this is close to home - but as another reviewer said - NO DICE!
