The first time I visited was a vacation here, before I moved.  We had rented a car for our vacation here in Arizona and visited Game Works one night for fun.  After we were done visiting game works we noticed that the rental car we had was keyed on one side so needless to say we had to pay a hefty fee to get it fixed.  We thought "eh..stuff happens" so we visited the mall after we moved here and came out to see our own car was in fact keyed.  After that we have tried to avoid this mall unless we really have to visit a store inside and if so we only go during the day. I would not recommend this mall unless you HAVE to go there.
