Coffee is fine, foo foo coffees are fine, pastries are fine, teas are fine, ambiance is pretty good with wireless and a nice selection of books to choose from, even location is pretty good. The problem, and it is a persistent problem with these people, is the service is terrible. Indifferent counter help on their best days, downright surly on their bad days. It's to the point where we won't even go in there anymore. Such potential...... lost to a crabby attitude towards the customers. If you want to own or work in a coffee shop then be ready to screw a smile on your face and show some positive energy.
