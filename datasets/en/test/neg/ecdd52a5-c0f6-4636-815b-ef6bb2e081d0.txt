My gripe is that when you serve imitation crab meat you MUST let people know.  Seriously, there are a lot of allergy sufferers out here and I am one and I do not like having an allergic reaction to something I should not have one to!  If you are going to serve nasty fly by night imitation food, I really can't eat there.  Sushi is sushi and it should be real and fresh.  Enough said!
