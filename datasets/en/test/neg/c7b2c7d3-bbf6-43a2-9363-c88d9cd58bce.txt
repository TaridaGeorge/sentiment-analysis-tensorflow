Absolutely atrocious pharmacy! I had a prescription called into this location and went to pick it up only to be told that they had no record of it. I called the physician that ordered it who explained that he had spoken to the pharmacist himself. I then called the pharmacy supervisor who was incredibly flippant and said they had been busy. He gave a half hearted apology but I told I'm I didn't think he was sorry at all. Awful. Under no circumstances should anyone get their prescriptions filled here.
