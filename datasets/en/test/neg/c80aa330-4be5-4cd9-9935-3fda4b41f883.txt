Just got home from eating there...

*****NEVER AGAIN!!*****

Service: POOR

Took 20 minutes to get Vegetable Spring Rolls to the table, and 30 seconds later came my Pad Thai.  8 minutes after that, my wife's Vegetable Curry came.

Food: POOR

Pad Thai:  Average (at best) flavor.  The shrimp may not have been fresh because they were awfully "fishy".

Vegetable Curry:  Flavorless (spice level 4 too!) 

They don't even have Thai cooks...they are Mexican!  I don't want Thai people cooking my Mexican food either!
