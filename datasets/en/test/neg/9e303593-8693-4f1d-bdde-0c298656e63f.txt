Dr.Christopher Lykins is a very nice guy but no a good doctor imho.
He misdiagnosed me which left me in a very awkward position, including spending hundred of dollars on medication which was not needed.
He also did not follow up on request for advise.
On another occasion he did not bother to return my phone calls at all for a referral.
Go see the Mayo Clinic instead, they are just a few miles away and treat you very professional.
