If I put an In-N-Out burger in a McDonald's wrapper, you'd hate it. I'd hate it. Everybody would hate it.

This place is one of those things that gives you some sort of perverted "foodie cred" if you claim you like it. Sure, I'd choose it over the big fast-food chains, but that's like saying I'd rather be kicked in my left testicle than in my right testicle.

In the end, I'm still being kicked in my nuts.

But if you're the type of person who thinks "ironic t-shirts" are actually witty, then you'll probably love In-N-Out.
