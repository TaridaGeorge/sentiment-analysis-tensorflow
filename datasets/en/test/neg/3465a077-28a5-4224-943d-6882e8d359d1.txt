While the deep fried pickles were wonderful, a unique variation using kosher dill pickle spears instead of chips, the remainder of our meal was a regrettable failure. Our remarkably poor service, given the fact that our table was almost IN the kitchen, didn't improve with a comment to the manager. Our server was clearly incapable of handling a group of 15 people, and the manager did little to ease her burden. After drinks, over priced because Lucille's doesn't honor happy hour prices in the dining room, it took almost 45 minutes between asking to have our food order taken, and the waitress actually being ready to take our order.
