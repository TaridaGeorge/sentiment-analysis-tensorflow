This place is EXTREMELY hit or miss. My date and I went after always smelling the greatness on our way to volleyball, and were both disgusted by our meals. Do NOT purchase the beef and zucchini or shrimp Panang. Both are not worth feeding to a rat. The crab rolls as an appetizer should just be thrown in the trash.... So terrible and basically stuffing your face with mint and a skin-like wrapper. Our friends even recommend certain dishes, but agree you can definitely go wrong at this place. I have been told to try the Pad Thai. Be weary of everything else.
