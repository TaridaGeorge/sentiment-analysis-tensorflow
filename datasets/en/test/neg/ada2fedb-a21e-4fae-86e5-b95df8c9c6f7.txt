The staff was too busy hanging out with each other to help much.
And when I asked about a certain beer, what kind it was, they couldn't answer / did not care.
They did offer Cincy-style chili but the place was so lackluster I didn't dare try.
Not much more to tell you. Not worth the visit.

Not going back.
