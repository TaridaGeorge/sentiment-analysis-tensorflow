The P.I.G. does not stand for the cute little animal that some love to eat. It stands for Pukey. Icky. Gross. 
How can a place that smells so good have food that tastes so bad? 
We walked in and looked at the menu before being seated. The food was overpriced but the restaurant smelled good and lets face it...rent in Desert Ridge is not cheap. 
This place offers all kinds of bbq (brisket, pork, chicken, salmon). The the bbq comes without sauce (including the ribs). The sauce is on the table. It made the food easier to swallow but was just average sauce. The only saving grace to my meal were the sweet potato fries. 
However, I think it is important to note, as bad as the food was....the service was EXCELLENT. 
Sad to say but this will be another Desert Ridge restaurant that won't last.
