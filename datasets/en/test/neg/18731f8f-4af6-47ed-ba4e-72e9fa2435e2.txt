Purchased a Groupon offer with these folks. They no showed when the appointment was scheduled and had some message on their phone saying that there was a 'technical' glitch and they lost all of the information.

Funny since I got an email on Saturday from Groupon confirming my appointment.

I smell a rat. Company did a deal with Groupon and could not handle the volume and made up some lame excuse to get out of it.

Honorable company would say "Leave your name and number and we will call you within 24 hours to take care of mistake"...not call them and see if you can get a refund.

Or how about this....ANSWER YOUR PHONE and don't hide behind a voice mail.
