Couldn't get to my regular salon (Elite Nails in Gilbert)  to get a fill (acrylic - pink and white) ... anyway this is on my way home and stopped in.   Horrible job... it was only a fill !!  Staff was not friendly.  Tried to pay with a debit card and got shamed into paying cash (what I had!) told the credit card charged them when I use my card.     

A lesson learned....   but back to my regular place.   Two thumbs down.
