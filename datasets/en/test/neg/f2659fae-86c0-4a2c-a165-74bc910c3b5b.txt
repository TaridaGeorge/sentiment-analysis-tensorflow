This restaurant is made for people who don't really know Arabic food, specifically, the kind that eat hummus with potato chips. You will not see real Mediterranean folks eating here. It's a joke. The hummus shouldn't be called hummus, a gyro without tzatziki sauce shouldn't be called a gyro, and falafel served out of a box shouldn't be called falafel!  Especially when the batter is super OLD and tastes like last decade's gingerbread.

I was surprised to hear a Syrian started this place up -- especially when I didn't see a single Arab in the kitchen! This explains the lousy food. Everything here tasted like it came out of a box, a Trader Joes plastic tub, or a Costco bag! SHAME. I looked around to see what other people were ordering, and it became crystal clear that the majority simply came to order drinks -- knowing the food sucks.
