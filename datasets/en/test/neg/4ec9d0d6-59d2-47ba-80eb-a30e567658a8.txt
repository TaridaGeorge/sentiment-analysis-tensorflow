Not pleased!  As a former patient of Dr. Zeman's I made an appt with Dr. Mitchell for another matter.  Had to cancel my appt due to a death of someone very close to me;  I was told to call back and reschedule.  When I did, they denied me an appt/being their patient because I cancelled last month.  I do not recommend a doctor's office that lacks compassion or understanding of fellow human beings.
