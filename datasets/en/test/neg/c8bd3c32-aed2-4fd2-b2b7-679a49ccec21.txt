Brought large group.  Told 30 minute wait. Bought beer when waiting. Horrible service.  They couldn't care less how long we waited.  Finally split us up.  Really what you want when you have family in town.  Our fault we didn't leave.  Unfortunate that the hostesses are clueless.   Don't bother coming here if you want service.
