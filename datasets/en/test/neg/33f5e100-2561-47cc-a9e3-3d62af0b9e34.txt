I wrote a similar review for Sonic drive-in. I don't eat fast food very often, although probably more than I should, however there are certain fast food places that always disappoint me. Every time I drive by a panda express I think to myself, "I haven't been there in a while it might be good", and every time, I leave feeling a little sick to my stomach and a little regretful. I'd much rather go next door to Rubios and get some fish tacos or a burrito.
