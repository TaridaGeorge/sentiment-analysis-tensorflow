Not impressed. I had not been here in a while but remembered as much better than it was tonight.  As I sit here my stomach hurts. We ordered a turkey burger, it was dry and had an odd taste combined with the taste of char (which was dominating). My husband got a mushroom burger, the mushrooms were so weird (chopped into nothing, clearly from a can and a sick yellow color). My daughters kids burger was all char no flavor.  Very disappointing.  We left most of our food, when the waitress came over she could see by the looks on our face that it was not going over well, she never offered anything.  Usually when most of the food except one or 2 bites are still on the plate that might trigger some alarm bells.
