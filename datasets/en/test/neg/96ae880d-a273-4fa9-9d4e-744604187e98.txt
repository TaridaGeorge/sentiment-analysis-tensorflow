Food: Not good. Dry meat in my cheeseburger, greasy fries in a basket. Burger fell apart into crumbs as I ate it. The bun was a hard baguette that I had to tear the corners off to get to the burger. Unfortunately I waited so long to receive it that I didn't feel like reordering.
Beer: Pretty good selection on tap and bottled.
Music: The worst. A drummer was pounding on a drum along with top 40 stuff they were playing, it was so loud and distracting I just could wait to get out of there. It was like listening to someone fail at Rock Band while listening to a teen-ager's iPod on full blast. 
It's a shame, because Gilbert needs some better options for nightlife. I was really hoping for a better experience.
