Service was horrible.  We ordered the Tom Yum soup, crab won tons and for the main entrees the Garlic shrimp and Mussaman house specialties. Soup was almost warm, garlic shrimp was OK, and crab won tons were cold. The house special meat was so chewy, I could not even finish one bite. After we sent it back, it only took 30 minutes to tell us we it will be 5-10 more minutes.
