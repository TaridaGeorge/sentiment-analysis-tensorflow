After a long craving for Korean food, I decided to dart into Soul Garden while in Tempe.  It had received mixed reviews, so I thought it was worth a shot.

The food was awful to the point of barely edible.  The meat was essentially lumps of fat and the prices were outrageous in comparison to the quality.

The most abysmal aspect of the experience was the service.  The waitress didn't have a great grasp of English and this made ordering difficult.  When we were done and ready for the check, we couldn't get anyones attention.

On the other side of the booth, the two women sat watching a small television.  We were the only customers in the restaurant the entire time.  Upon catching their eyes, they would pointedly look away.  Eventually we were able to get the check and left unhappily.
