Dark and kind of dirty, phantom smells seem to come from the carpets. Not sure how I would feel about eating the food from a place who's guest occupied spaces are so dilapidated. As far as the guests really fit the decor. dingy, dirty and depressing. Not the place to go if you want to have a good time with friends. servers are always overwhelmed and drinks are extremely weak. There's much better places to watch a game in the valley.... pretty much ANYWHERE else.
