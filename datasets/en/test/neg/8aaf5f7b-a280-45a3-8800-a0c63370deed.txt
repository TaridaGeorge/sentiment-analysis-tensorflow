I think the $8 buffet is cheap.  A great price for sure.  On the subject of the food, I couldn't disagree more.  

The crust is thin, without the benefit of being crispy.  The sauce is bland and tastes like it came from #10 can.  The cheese is melted is probably the best thing I can say about the pizza at LJ's.  My favorite item was the fountain beverage.

If you like to be adventurous, try LJ's you might enjoy the sauerkraut pizza.

As for me, if I really needed to eat out on the cheap, I would rather go to Eatsa Pizza for lunch . . . the buffet costs less and the food is, marginally, better.
