Well it's basically a crap shoot eating here. It can be really good or really bad. This place is lacking in consistency where the service and food is concerned. The shrimp is either undercooked and slimy or cooked with a nasty vein left behind.  The wait staff will either be on top of everything or rude and leave you sitting waiting for 30 min asking over and over for the same thing (bread or water) walking by smiling as you flag them down " excuse me may I have some water please?" for the twelfth time I think to myself. Sheesh! What's up with service here? Consistently Inconsistent. All in all not happy. I'm finished with this place. Too bad because the food can be good at times.
