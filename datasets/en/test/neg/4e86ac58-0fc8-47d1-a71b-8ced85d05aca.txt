No fried food, no ranch, no business being a bar. The beer selection is great I can't lie there, but if the latex clad goth oddballs who wander in  don't put you off and bitter snarky waitresses who couldn't tell an ipa from a hole in the wall isn't a big deal to u then proceed with caution. BTW if the half lit sign outside hanging over the door proudly proclaiming "----go" buzzing like a bug zapper doesn't convince you to turn and run then well...you'll deserve what comes next ;)
