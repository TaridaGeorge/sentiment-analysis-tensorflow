Flo's "Asian" Kitchen...?  Where is the Asian food?  The food had no flavor whatsoever!  It makes the ultra gross chain restaurant PF Changs seem like Asian food in my opinion.  Not to mention this "Asian" restaurant is extremely overpriced!  I know this is Scottsdale, but come on.  Makes me miss California more and more...
