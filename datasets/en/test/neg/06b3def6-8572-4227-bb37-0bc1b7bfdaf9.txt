I went Honey Bear's with my wife to use a Groupon.  We like to try different places, not get stuck on one place and we were disappointed with Honey Bear's.

We got the pulled pork and BBQ chicken. The pork was dry with no smokey flavor. The chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor. The sauce was too sweet for me as well, overpowering everything it's put on.

The sides of beans and corn were nothing  special as well. At the end. We were glad we tried them because it made us feel better about our favorite BBQ, Waldos in Mesa. 

We'll keep trying, but we believe no one will ever compare.
