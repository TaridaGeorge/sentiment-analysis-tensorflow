On weekends stay away. The DJ sucks and seems to draw pleasure from dissing people to make himself feel important. They don't serve food, unless you like jerkey, the place is very small,  the bathrooms are bad and the place feels clicky. Like if your not a regular, you get strange looks. I've heard the karaoke is good here, so maybe during the week with less people there it could be Ok. No karaoke on weekends, so I should have done my homework. Save the dive bars for the weekdays.
