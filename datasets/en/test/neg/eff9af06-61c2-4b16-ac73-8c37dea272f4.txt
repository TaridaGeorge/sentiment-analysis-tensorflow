Laughable. Nice restaurant, and our waitress was nice but come on, three tacos on a "home-made" tortilla the size slightly bigger than a half dollar?  I'm no chef, but I'm pretty sure I know how to grill steak, place it on a small corn tortilla and sprinkle some conte cheese on top and call it a meal.  The only saving grace is that it is located near a Rubios where I currently sit having a real lunch that is much better and cheaper.
