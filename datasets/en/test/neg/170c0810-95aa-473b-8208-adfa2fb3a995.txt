I always give places a second chance. This doesn't deserve a third.

First time, I ordered a hot sandwich. It came out with bread so smooshed it was as thin as a tortilla, and the meat on the inside was cold (refrigerator cold).

I figured it was a breakfast place, so I came back and ordered crepes. Tasteless crepes.
