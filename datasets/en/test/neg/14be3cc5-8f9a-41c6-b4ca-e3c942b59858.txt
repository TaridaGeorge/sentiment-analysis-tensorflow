I found a coupon for a $18.88 basic oil change and tire rotation. Not only did they not rotate my tires, they overfilled the oil and charged me a $9 shop fee in addition to the $18.88 so my basic oil change came out to $30 with tax. Two other Just Brakes locations in the same area stated that their shop fees are only $3 and it should have come out to a total of $23 including tax. Honest mistake or scam? Based on the previous reviews on Google a pattern of poor service and overcharging is emerging at this location...buyer beware!
