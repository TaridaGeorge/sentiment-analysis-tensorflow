Attempted to check this place out tonight because I heard it was good. I'm on travel for business and my company gave me an American Express card for all my expenses. Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care.
