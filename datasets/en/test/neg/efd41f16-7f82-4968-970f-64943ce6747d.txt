Can I give negative stars please? About a year ago, one of my roommates ate at this place and ended up getting very sick. A few weeks later, my other room mate took a walk down to this location and *surprise!* he got sick as well. Against my better judgment, I still stopped by to get a bite on my way home one day and full blown food poisoning. Seriously? If 3 different people get majorly ill on 3 different occasions then I would have to say that there is something wrong with this place. How the health department has not shut it down yet is beyond me.
