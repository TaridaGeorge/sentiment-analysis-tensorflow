Let me set the record here. Juicy Couture is NOT COUTURE. Its two dumb bimbo girls who thought they were bing cute by making sluttly over-priced jogging suits with juicy embriodered just so on the ass and who acknowledge that they 1) don't really try 2) definitely dont do couture, but make a "joke" out of it (i dont see how it is a joke but whatever) and 3) they are essentially trashbag, dimestore, raggedy-ass hoes.. It is T-R-A-S-H-Y. This applies to all locations and divisions of Juicy. It is an abonination to the Fashion World.

by the way velor is disgusting... f.y.i.
