So so sad to see this mall go downhill.  It has become totally ghetto.  I was so disappointed to go there on the weekend and the mariachi music is playing so loudly that you can't even think!  We went to Best Buy the night of Thanksgiving and then walked around the mall after, there again, mariachi music playing so loud that we couldn't even talk above it.  
It is also sad to see all the food places pulling out, first it was Chick-Fil-A, then the American Grill, then Maggie's pitas.  
I don't understand why it has gone the direction it has, it is right off the freeway and with MCC and Banner Desert so close, you would think it would be thriving.
