Huge place with comfortable seating.  That's all the positive things I can think to say about it.  My fiance stopped eating halfway through his plate for fear that he'd be sick if he continued.  I soldiered through, because I had been craving chinese buffet all day.  I took a sip of the hot and sour soup and could barely even recognize what I was tasting.  It was just WEIRD.  The orange chicken and sesame chicken weren't too bad, but just about everything else was too dried out (we were there at 6 so it should have been fresh), or was overloaded with large pieces of onion.  Someone got lazy with the chopping, I guess.  We didn't try the mongolian bbq.  Maybe that would have been okay, but we'll never know, because we won't be going back.
