Walked in to get a cappuccino. A worker greats me and looks puzzled when I ask for a cappuccino. He asked me to wait while he calls someone. I wait for like 5 min and the waitress shows up. I tell her I'd like to get a cappuccino, to go. She looks at me wired and tells me "they only have a home espresso makers, not the industrial kind, and it takes a long time to heat it since it's broken" (?! --no idea what that means).

I'm not a big fan of Starbucks but that was the other option (20 feet away) so ended up going there. Tryst sucks.
