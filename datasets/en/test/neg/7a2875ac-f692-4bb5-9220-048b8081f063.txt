REALLY DISAPPOINTED!   If it wasn't for the "groupon"  I would have felt mugged. My date and I went for some pizza and wine. An HOUR later our "pizza" arrived.  A burnt-lavosh cracker is NOT a pizza folks.   I am all about a thin crust pizza but this was not thin crust pizza it is a lavosh topped with a miserly amount of cheese and burnt black.   The wine pour was meager at best as well.   If you think seven dollars for about 3oz. of wine with an eleven dollar cracker is good eats , then this is the place for you.   It is a day later and I am still irritated thinking I wasted my time and money here.   They do supply blankets if you eat outside.  I guess propane space-heaters were too expensive.
