I'm certainly no burger aficionado, but having eaten at Burger King, McDonald's, In and Out Burger etc., I understand what to expect from greasy, mediocre, fast food. This was not mediocre in any way, but virtually inedible. The only thing I could compare it to is what you used to get out of a vending machine and then proceed to microwave. Absolutely the worst burger I've ever eaten in my life.
