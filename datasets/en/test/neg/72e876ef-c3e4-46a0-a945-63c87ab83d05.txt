Time warp banking. Very low tech. Like banking in the early '70s. Ditched their checking account, but kept the Visa Credi Card. 
The free checking was nice because it would refund the fees that other banks charge for using their ATMs. But the customer has to do all the work by saving the receipts and mailing to Birmingham, AL. Other banks offer this but the computer system keeps track and automatically rebates the fees at the end if the cycle. If you complain about it the just say "This is the way we do it"
