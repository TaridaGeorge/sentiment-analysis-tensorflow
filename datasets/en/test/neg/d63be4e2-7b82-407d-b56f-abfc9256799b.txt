I was extremely disappointed. When you call yourself a gourmet sandwich shop, it must be better than subway.  When I first walked in, there was no customers in the store at all. I was not greeted at all by the 4 workers that were working there. What was even worse was when I got up to the counter, I was met with the "stupid" stare like I should have just automatically started ordering and that I was a bother to her.  When you have a new business, a worker like that can have such a negative impact on your future.  Then there was the food. You get less meat than subway, less vegetables, in fact you don't get a choice I guess, and the bread tasted like it was a couple of days old and not fresh. I will not be returning.
