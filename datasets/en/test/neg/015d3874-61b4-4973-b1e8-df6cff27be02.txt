They keep deleting my post, but I am just going to keep reposting it :)  

Not the kind of person I want to give my money to. Did not present a coupon in the correct format so I was told I couldn't be helped. Owner was rude and did not seem to care. I would rather pay more at a store that is happy to serve me.

( I got the stuff I wanted online for less and got great service to boot! )
