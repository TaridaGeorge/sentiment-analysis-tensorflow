cons: no tea at a KOREAN restaurant, no water refill even though they should know it's like 200 degrees outside in PHOENIX and really, do they not realize how spicy the majority of their food is??, waitresses didn't know what the hell they were doing, didn't let me replace beef for pork, and yes, i'm just being petty as this point but their pen had no ink when we signed the receipt but we were just too fed up with everything else!


pros: very clean place (because it's fairly new), especially the bathroom. 

i know there aren't many korean restaurants in phoenix, but don't eat here. they really have no clue how to run a restaurant.
