It's Sunday, right?

Do I have your attention?  It's Sunday, and Barry's Capezio is closed, right?  You need dance supplies for yours or your daughter's dancing class tomorrow and the dance store that you always go to is closed.   You're looking for an alternative and you found this place.  Please don't be tempted.

When we went, service seemed friendly, but the consequences for our choice came later.  Our daughter was about ready to begin classes for pointe, and we described to them our situation.  We, on their advice, walked out with demi-pointe shoes--this was the WRONG ADVICE!  No fitting (other than to try them on), no advice as to care, just hand us the shoes and ring us up.  Nothing else.  To see the pain on my daughter's face after that first class was agonizing, as were the huge blisters all over her feet.

Wait.  Please wait until Monday.
