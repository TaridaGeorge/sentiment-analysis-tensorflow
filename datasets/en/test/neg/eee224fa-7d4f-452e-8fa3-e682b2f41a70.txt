This place is horrible. I always avoided it for food, it's just bad especially with so many other options in the area. We decided to go for just drinks and after one round our server abandoned us. Never to be found again. We finally asked someone else to close is out after waiting 30 min in hopes someone would come. We awaited another 15 min as he attempted to find our ticket. We received the tab, no sorry, no anything. We quickly closed out and left. I will NEVER come back, with Eddie Vs, Zinc and North dominating the service and food in that area there's no reason to ever even go back.
