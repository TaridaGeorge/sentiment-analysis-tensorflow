The line begins to form before 7am. The doors open at 8. Is this a Motley Crue concert or the DMV? 

Imagine the slowest most agonizing death possible. Add to that scene giggling teenagers and zombie-like civil servants and the waiting for your number to be called as if you're at the deli at Fry's. All that's between you and waiting another 2 hours is a tiny slip of paper with a letter followed by three numbers.

"our computer is down, we can't print out your license so you'll have to visit another location" 

-next location @ 26th Ave & the 101-

"our computer is down, we can't..."

Pfffft!
