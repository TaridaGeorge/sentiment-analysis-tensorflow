I have been the the rum bar 2 times before and the service was fine as was the food. Stopped by tonight and was meeting a friend for drinks. I arrived early, they told me I had to sit in the waiting area until my party arrived. There was NO ONE IN THE PLACE. Yet I couldn't sit at a table and be served a drink? Or be ask to have a seat at the bar??? No I had to sit right by the door on a bench.  I went to Turf around the corner where they welcomed my drink order while I waited for my friend. 

Way to pretentious for me...I won't be back
