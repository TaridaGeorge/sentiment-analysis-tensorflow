I went to this place because it was closed my hotel in Phoenix downtown and it is 4-star in Yelp. 

To my disappointment, there was no meat to pick and very limited vegi for stir fry. so we decided to order the regular dishes. 

There were just a couple of tables but the service was very slow. The dishes are very tiny for the price and the tea would cost extra. 

Overall, This is NOT an authentic Chinese food restaurant. Might be a place that just caters the lunch for people working in downtown.
