Terrible pizza, ordered margarita pizza & the toppings slid right off the crust, and the crust was soggy.  Breadsticks tasted like icky too. Won't be coming back!!!

Stay away from this restaurant!!!!!  Wondering if the same owner owns the Street of New York in Ocotillo area, their food is really good, not sure what happened to this one????
