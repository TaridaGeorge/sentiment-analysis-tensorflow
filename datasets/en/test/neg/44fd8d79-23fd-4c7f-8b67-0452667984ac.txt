We have been buying tamales here for a few years.  The last two years we have ordered for Christmas eve dinner.  We put in an order so we can be sure to have them because they apparently run out.  We called several days before Christmas this week to order and was told " we are not taking orders"  and was told we could come in Friday or Sat. to pickup.  My husband went in Fri.  to get the tamales and was told they don't have any becuase of orders!!!  Are you freaking kidding me?!  Now we have no tamales for Christmas eve dinner. Dinner is ruined and it's too late to get anywhere else.  I will not be buying anymore food here for personal or for business.  Also I will be telling everyone I work with.  Horrible service.
