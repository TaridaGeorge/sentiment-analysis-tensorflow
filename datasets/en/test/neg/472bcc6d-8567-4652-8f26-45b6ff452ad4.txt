Wish I could give it zero starts. The food isn't great, the workers seem lazy, management doesn't seem to care. I usually go to mayo blvd and get a green smoothie while I shop. I came to this location and I got an instant migraine from the green smoothie. I asked if they use organic produce in the smoothies and the worker told me "we don't advertise organic produce! " like I was insane to even ask. Umm...it is WHOLE foods! The mayo location uses organic produce. Always! I complained to management and they didn't give a rats ass. My son has severe issues with pesticides, even has seizures at times. This is a big deal. Whole foods, I expected more from you! I will stick to the mayo location from now on. It's much nicer and bigger too.
