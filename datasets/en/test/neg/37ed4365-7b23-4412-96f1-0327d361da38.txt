My friend and I came in looking for pedicure before we headed back home to the bay area. We both got a pedicure and I got a manicure to. They were pretty nice, although thelady my friend had kept trying to upsell her on this special manicure and just wasn't getting the hint. She was pushy and rude. The lady cut my friends skin on almost every nail and now she has a FUNGUS infection in one of her fingers. I now have a fungus infection in my big toe! That is DISGUSTING!!! This place is DIRTY and UNSANITARY! The place I go out here always pulls their tools from a sanitized pack and every client gets a new pack. If im ever back in the area I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!
