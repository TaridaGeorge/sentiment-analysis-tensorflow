The one star is for the extremely dangerous parking garage.  While exiting the underground parking, it is virtually impossible to see oncoming pedestrians due to the grade, construction and wooden signs put out to advertise the parking structure itself.  It is just a matter of time before someone gets severely injured or killed.  This is a huge oversight and an accident waiting to happen.
