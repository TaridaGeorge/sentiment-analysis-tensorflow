Food was okay, nothing too special.   Service was awful.  

Drink refills were non existent, finally hot refil after the meal was completed.   Asked for roll refil which never came.   Never received at condiments that were requested (one person had a burger and wanted mustard).

Staff all was not overly friendly to the point the impression is nobody wanted to be there.


Waitress nor the manager ever came by to ask how everything was.

Would not recommend this location
