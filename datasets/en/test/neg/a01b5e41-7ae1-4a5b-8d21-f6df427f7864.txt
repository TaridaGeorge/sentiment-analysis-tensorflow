I have attended this club sporadically since it opened sometime in 2010. It has had its up's and down's in terms of basic club/bar service, it may depend on what night you attend.  My main complaint is that If you ever need to contact someone of authority at this club, (don't even bother.) But say you Lost/left something behind at the club? Had and altercation with a bouncer? Were double charged by the bartended on your credit card?  Have a complaint? Have a compliment?  The staff is uncooperative and rude no matter what your situation is.Id stay away from this club, there are other bars and clubs that cater to the same patrons. I always feel welcomed to spend my money everywhere/anywhere else in Phoenix.
