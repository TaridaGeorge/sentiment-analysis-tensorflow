I don't like writing bad reviews but the grub at this place was bad and expensive (it is downtown) - tacos were so sad. It was $8-$9 which got me three tiny tacos with bland, watery meat and some shreds of cabbage on top of the soggy corn tortilla. The salsa bar (big whoop - they are dirty and for lazy restaurants like Baja Fresh) didn't salvage the tacos either. No merci!

Even after a beer with the meal, I had to make myself something else to eat when we got home. I'm not a big eater either.
