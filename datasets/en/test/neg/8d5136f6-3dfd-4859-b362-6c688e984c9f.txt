Errrr, The grounds look nice, up to the gate at least...I was turned away at the gate because I did not know anybody staying at the hotel. 

I said well my family is coming to town and I wanted to check out the resort, the bulldog at the gate at the gate insisted that if I did not know anybody staying at the resort I could not come in. Then he asked for my families name, I a fit of confusion I said 'huh, what, why, ummm I guess I'll turn around' 'yeah turn around please...and as I was pulling away the gate keeper said something that I didn't catch that sounded pretty snooty. 

Seems a little ass-backwards to me treating potential guests in such a way.
