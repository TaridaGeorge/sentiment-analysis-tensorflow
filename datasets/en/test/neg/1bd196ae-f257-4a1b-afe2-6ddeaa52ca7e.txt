I abhor this park. I'm spoiled; we've been taking the kids to Chaparral since we foraged the audacity to let them out of the house, but still... really? This is it? It's not even a park, it's a trailhead. There have never been poop baggies stocked, and seeing another dog there is like seeing anyone with any sense of decency at Suede. Yuck. I'll stick with Chaparral.
