So I called to order dinner for four to go.  Was advised that this restaurant "does not do to go orders."  Can anyone believe that in this economy we have a place snooty enough that they don't "do to go orders???"  Lucky for me, there are numerous other steakhouses with equal or better food so no sweat.
