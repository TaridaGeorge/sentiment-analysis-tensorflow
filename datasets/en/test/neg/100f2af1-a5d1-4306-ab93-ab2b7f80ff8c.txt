Can all the Fresh & Easys please just pack up and move to an island surrounded by all of the unnecessary packaging that they use?  That would be awesome.  Come on, people, do you really need each serving individually packed in its own non-biodegradable container?  When I want one onion, do I really have to buy a bag of four onions (one red, one yellow, and two white)?  Not cool!  Fresh and Easy is completely ridiculous and unnecessary, IMHO.
