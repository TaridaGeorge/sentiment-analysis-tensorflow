While I have not eaten at this particular NNY( I moved here from NY and is not that "native"...at all) it's 2 min away from where I live.Food is meh at the other ones though.  I just saw Devon review and I'm appalled and disgusted. If in fact it's  true, I will never visit this restaurant and will urge everyone I know to do the same as well. It is one thing to have different believes and a whole other to display such hatred and bigotry. 
I appreciate this type of reviews, that way I can avoid places like this.
