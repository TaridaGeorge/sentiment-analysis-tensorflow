I love green. I've been eating there for a few years now, and while it may not be the healthiest veg good, it is delicious. I was very disappointed today when one of the girls (a blonde haired girl) at the front desk was incredibly rude  after I inquired about the kind of "meat" being used. She refused to talk to me about it, saying it was secret. Shocked, I stated that businesses really should disclose that type of info without hesitation, and she said "no, they don't and aren't going to." I thought she was very hostile even though I was just curious. It's not like I was going to try and steal their recipes!  Staff should be friendly and understanding about questions, its what makes customers trust and support their efforts.
