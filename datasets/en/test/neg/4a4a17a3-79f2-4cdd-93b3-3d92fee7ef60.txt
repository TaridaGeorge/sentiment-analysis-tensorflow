We love good BBQ so thought that we would try Stacy's since it's in the neighborhood.  What a disappointment.  

Was there at lunch on a Saturday.  Both of us had the lunch combo -- pulled pork sandwich on hers, brisket on mine.  Her pork was good but unremarkable.  My brisket was awful.  A thick layer of fat had not been removed before it was sliced, and the brisket was sliced along the grain of the meat rather than across the grain, which made it a lot less tender.

We had cole slaw and BBQ beans for sides.  The cole slaw was returned because it tasted off.  When steamed veggies were requested, we were advised that they were still frozen.  If Stacy's wants to figure out what BBQ beans should taste like, try Honey Bear's.

Sad that we wasted nearly $20 for a lousy lunch.  Will never be back.
