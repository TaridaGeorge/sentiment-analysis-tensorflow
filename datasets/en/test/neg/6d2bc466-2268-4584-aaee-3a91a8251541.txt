i went here to get a back fill on my nails last week and had one of the worst experiences ever...not only are the nails crooked and bumpy but i left with acrylic covering my bleeding fingers. unfortunately i also spent the entire 90 minutes listening to the woman doing my nails hack up a lung because she was sick. 

a friend was on her way to meet me and i told her what i'm telling you, turn around and go somewhere else. they may do a decent job on a full set but the back fill made me regret entering the door
