Ok , I here good stuff about this place and the floor is cool. 

I went to eat there and ordered something with cilantro, it tasted like I was eating the entire bush of cilantro .

Everything else was gross too. 

Not to mention the violent diareah ( not sure of spelling, too lazy. Well I guees in the time I took righting all of this I could have spell checked?)

At least I lost weight :)

Unless you want to become violently ill for dietary purose dont eat here.
