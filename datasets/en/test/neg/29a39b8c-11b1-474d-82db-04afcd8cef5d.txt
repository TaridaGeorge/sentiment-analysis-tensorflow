OMG. People need to wake up. Ra was good once. When it FIRST opened. Now that it is corporate and owned by Benihana it has turned into the Applebees of the sushi world. One thing I dont want a sushi restaurant to skimp on is the quality of fish. It has gone downhill. The Old Town location is the worst. How they get away with it with so much competition is nuts. Thank GOD the new Pure Sushi location just opened. It is in the Scottsdale Civic Center next to the Mondrian and AZ88. Beautiful, stylish place.  Google map that shit! The only sushi restaurant that should be more ashamed of themselves is Sushi Roku. But at least they are new and still workin out kinks. Anyway.. Happy New Year all!
