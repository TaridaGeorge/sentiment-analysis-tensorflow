the food is terrible.... we sent 1 order back and they were highly offended, i was offened they even served it to me... everything was dripping with grease, over fried, over cooked garbage. the manager/owner said if you don't like the food thats not my problem, i think it is when you only have 4 tables being used on a Friday evening

if you want real, tasty, authentic food, go to Las Cazuelas, 16551 N Dysart Rd ste 101, Surprise... DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT Lupita's Dump.

you'll spend more on toilet paper then you did on your bill, cause your stomach will reject this trash.....
