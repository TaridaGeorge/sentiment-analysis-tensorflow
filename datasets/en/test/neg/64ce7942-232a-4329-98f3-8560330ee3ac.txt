I used to be a customer....even tho the fries always sucked.... but tonite I was called a BITCH by the owners son, because I asked for the $2.00 off discount offered on an $18.00 pizza...I was told that the discount is now offered on Saturday only.... I tried to explain that my menu didnt reflect that.....he argued and I asked if he wanted to fight over $2.00 or should I order somewhere else? He said "order somewhere else" and hung up....I called back from my husbands  phone and the same guy(owners son) answered and when I asked for a manager, he said ITS THAT BITCH.....I actually tried to get the owner to understand, but thats his MOMMY....SOOOOOO THATS NOT gonna happen......... I HOPE AMELIOS GOES DOWN HARD!!!!!!  do NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM...... IVE SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY TO BE TREATED LIKE SHIT
