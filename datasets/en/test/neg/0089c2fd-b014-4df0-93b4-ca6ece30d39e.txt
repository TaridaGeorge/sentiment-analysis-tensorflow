Took over 20 mins to get 2 burgers, and fries. The burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy. Employee "Jared" was too busy eating in the back room, throwing punches in the air, and then talking to another employee about wanting to get off early, rather than help customers. My Wife and I have eaten here in the past, and the experience was bad. This time, I told her that if I suggest going here again, to smack me.
