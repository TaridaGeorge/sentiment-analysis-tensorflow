They were accommodating with our orders as all five of us had to hold various ingredients from the wraps/sandwiches.  The staff was not rude, but not particularly friendly either.

Then we got the food....AWEFUL!  Didn't they ever see that old-school commercial about not drowning your food?!  All I could taste was the sauce.  I couldn't taste the actual ingredients...I didn't think they were particularly fresh, plus not much ingredients other than the dressing.  It wasn't particularly healthy or "Gourmet."  Out of the 5 of us, we all said we wouldn't go back!  Very expected for a casual chain restaurant.
