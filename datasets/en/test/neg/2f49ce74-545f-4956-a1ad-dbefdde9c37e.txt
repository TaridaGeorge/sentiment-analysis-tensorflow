TERRIBLE service. Absolutely terrible. Slow and incompetent waitress.  We waited 15 minutes before the waitress finally came over to take our drink order, we were never asked if we wanted more to drink, then after 45 minutes, we had to flag down the waitress to see where our food was even though the bar was virtually empty.  She said she would go check and then came back with cold wings, but none of the rest of our food.  We sent them back, paid for our beers and left.
