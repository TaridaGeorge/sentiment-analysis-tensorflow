Maybe it was a fluke and a long day. We got served cold pizza and the girl behind the counter could care less.  Once the slice was served hot the sauce was a bit too sweet and the slice was missing an important ingredient - CHEESE.  Well I guess they must be doing something right as some people seem to love them.
