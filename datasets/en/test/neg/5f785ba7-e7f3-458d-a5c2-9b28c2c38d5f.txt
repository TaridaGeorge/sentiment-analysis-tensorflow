Very bad mother's day special prime rib.  Ordered rare, got brown, no red, no juices coming out.  They said they could not do better. 

We requested bread and that seemed unusual and a problem.  We finally got it with our bad meal.

We order a side of asparagus, since they said no sides come with it.  The asparagus was overcooked and served cold.

This is not a place for meat eaters.
