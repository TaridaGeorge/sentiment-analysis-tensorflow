Christmas party at Greekfest. I had the steak and my wife had the salmon. I suppose it is possible that they were having a bad night but everything seemed nearly flavorless.

None of it was good.

The desert was about the only thing worth having.

The atmosphere was great and the staff was helpful but they need to rework the kitchen if they want to stay in business.
