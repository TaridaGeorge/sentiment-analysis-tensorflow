I gave up on this place years ago, when it first opened in its original location.  Nothing was priced, the owner was incredibly rude, and everything I asked for pricing on was strangely $1000 + (even a lamp I already owned and paid $20 for at a thrift store).  It was as if he didn't think I was worthy of owning any of his furniture.  I have since frequently seen him at estate and yard sales around phoenix, buying furniture for $150 which I then see priced close to $1000 in the shop.  I have also heard complaints that he has sold recovered furniture as all-original vintage! Give your money to someone kind who is not out to scam you like RED is......
