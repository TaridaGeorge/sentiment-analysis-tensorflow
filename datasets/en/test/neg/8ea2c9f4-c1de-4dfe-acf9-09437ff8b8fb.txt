Unimpressed, been there once when it first opened and havent been back since. I have to say, after having experienced real Italian pizza made by real italians in Argentina,  any pizza establishment will have the unfortunate task of rising up to certain taste levels. 

Not only is the menu limited, the place seems overcrowded and service convoluted. My pizza (if u can call it pizza) seemed like cardboard pizza and with not enough cheese or sauce. My friend had a calzone that he ate with disgust and disappointment.
