This place is NOT good. It smelled inside and the food was by far the worst Thai I've ever had.

We usually go to Taste of Thai, but when I saw this had more reviews and a higher rating, we decided to give it a try. What a mistake!!! The pad thai was gross, the spring rolls were disgusting, the green curry was ok but the tom ka ghai was horrible! 

Yelpers really let me down on this one! I think it is recently under new management, so maybe these reviews are out of date, so steer clear!
