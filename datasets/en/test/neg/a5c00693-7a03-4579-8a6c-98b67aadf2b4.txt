This place is terrible.  If you want to eat mediocre food, pay a lot of money, and leave hungry then this place is for you...
I arranged a dinner with some out of towners and wanted to take them somewhere I haven't been before.  Yelp has always been a reliable resource so I looked up highly rated restaurants and found the "Nobuo at Teeter House".  
First off the wait staff was FAIL...the guy we had couldn't pronounce most of the items on the menu.  We ordered the pork belly buns (overly fatty), curry lamb chops (burnt), Okonomiyaki (bland), parchment wrapped fish (unoriginal).  The only dishes I did enjoy was the duck breast salad and the New Year's special Foie Grau.   Needless to say $150 dollars for a mediocre dinner left a bad taste in my mouth and my guests unimpressed.  I will never go back to this place.
