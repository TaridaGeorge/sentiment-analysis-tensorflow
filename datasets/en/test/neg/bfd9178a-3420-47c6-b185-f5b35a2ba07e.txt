I was so disappointed by my dinner here!!! I had a chicken dish that tasted really bad.  The sauce was runny and had an odd flavor. Everyone in our party agreed that the food just wasn't good! It's quite pricey too. I will NOT be returning.  I feel bad for them because a lot of restaurants go out of business on Market Street.  They really need some help here!
