Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back.
