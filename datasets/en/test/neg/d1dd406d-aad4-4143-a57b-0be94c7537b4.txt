Fibbers used to be a very nice neighborhood pub, with good food and reasonably priced drinks. The wait staff has recently become so inattentive or indifferent, that I would simply not go back unless it was to sit at the bar. Terrible shame, really, as it was one of my very favorite local watering holes. Hopefully they will turn things around, and hire more waiters/waitresses, or bring in people who care. I will not be returning any time soon.
