Except the car is in good sharp, there is no customer service.  When I was at different lane to get out, the AVIS associates was sitting at the gate without walk to my lane and check me out.  Instead, I have to back the car, move to the lane they were sat.  Speak with horrible tone and rude.  Moreover, they said if I pass 1 min of my return time, they will charge me for a extra day.  Avoid AVIS, Hertz gave me much better experiences.
