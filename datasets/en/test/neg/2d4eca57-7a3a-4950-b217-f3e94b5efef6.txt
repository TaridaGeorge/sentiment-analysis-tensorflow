Aweful all around. Waited 20 minutes to get seated and then waited another forty for our food - which we received four sushi pieces and the waitress told us they were out of the other sushi we ordered. Yet the table behind us was getting plenty of sushi delivered to them. The price was was to expensive for what we received and the staff didn't even apoligize for not coming over sooner to let us know they were out of what we ordered. 

Good thing the company I went with was great to pass the time
