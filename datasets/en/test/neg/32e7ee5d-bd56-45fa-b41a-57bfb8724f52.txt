I was SOOOO EXCITED to eat here.

For realz.

I love breakfast foods.  Of all kinds.

But I would rather eat at IHOP than this place.  Honestly.

I've tried all their variations on the eggs benedict, and found them all to be so disgusting they bordered on inedible.

A friend of mine insists that I should return to this place and order a "sweet" breakfast, but I'm scared and very hesitant to ever eat here again.
