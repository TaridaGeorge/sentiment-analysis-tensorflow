I made an appointment to get my oil changed there, since it's near my house and I thought it would be really quick.  My Appointment was at four and the desk technician told me it would be at most 30 minutes to do it, so I waited there.  Fourty five minutes later my car hasn't moved from the parking lot so I ask the manager what's going on and the pull my car in twenty minutes after that, I didn't get my car back till 5:45.  I should have just demanded my keys back after waiting 45 minutes for them to move my car instead of the disappointment of a thirty dollar oil change that lasted 1 hours and 45 minutes.
