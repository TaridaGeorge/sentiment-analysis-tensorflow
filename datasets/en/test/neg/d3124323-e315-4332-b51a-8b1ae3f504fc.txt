I picked this particular OG because it is the closest offender, geographically, to my compound.

As succinctly as possible: you suck the life out of Italian Food, you bastards. You are the epitome of all that is wrong with corporate food service. The only way that you could add more salt and remove more life from your food is if you were called "The Red Olive Lobster Garden".

You suck. You know you suck. And you are killing people with your crappy food. Die.

(apparently, I have to give you 1 star. suck it.)
