This place is for the absolute desperate. Literally, this basement is crawling with hungry people just hoping they find a good tasting crumb. I'm sorry to be the one to say this, but it's almost borderline pathetic! 

After going here, and reading the reviews now, I really have no clue why anyone would want other people's dirty crap. And when I say dirty, I don't mean a little worn, I mean mud stained, sweat stained shoes, purses with crap smeered on it. Horrible smelling clothes. Crying babies. Freaky people. Long lines. Who cares if it's labeled with some high end brand. Set yourself some standards, save yourself some time, and don't bother looking at Last Chance.
