No problem with the food here, just the service. I have ordered food from here 3 times, once takeout and twice delivery. Everytime I have put an order in here they get something on the order wrong. When I try to make a complaint about it the staff is very rude and not apologetic at all. This location has very young girls taking the orders and it is my feeling that they don't pay attention very well since they get the order wrong every time. I will never order from this location again because of the terrible service and uncaring staff.
