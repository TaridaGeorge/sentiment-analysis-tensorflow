This was the most AWFUL experience I have ever had! This was my 1st time there and I had the lunch special--bbq chicken with rice and 2 crab apps. There were about 5 people in the place and it took 20 minutes to get my food!!!!!! So by this time I am starving and as I go to dig in, the chicken is 100% fatty and tasteless. So I asked to try the pork instead. It looked like a pile of barf. I took one bite and threw it out. The service SUCKED and the 2 people working there had ZERO personality! I would never ever ever go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!
