Usually, if I go to a bar & grill restaurant, I just go with the burger because it is hard to mess up.  But I have been trying to eat a little healthier.  I went with the spicy chix wrap which was no bueno.  It was overly salty, rather than spicy and there wasn't much chix.  It was loaded with a sauce and some salad reject items that were not appetizing and was very dissatisfying.  Ironically, the burger would have probably been the healthier choice.  

Also, don't get the tortilla soup.  it is a bunch of stale tortilla chips on a watery mess that no one in good conscience could call a soup.
