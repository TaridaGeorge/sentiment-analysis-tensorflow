I bought a deal for carpet cleaning and scheduled my appointment. An hour after my appointment time, they called to cancel. (They claimed the truck broke down... same thing I see in another review here in February & I saw another complaint posted on the deal site in April with the same excuse. If their truck is really breaking down every month, they need a new truck.) They were apologetic and said they would call back the next day to reschedule. After getting no call back, I have since left 3 messages in the past two weeks that have all gone un-returned. At this point, I would not use them even if they did eventually call back.
