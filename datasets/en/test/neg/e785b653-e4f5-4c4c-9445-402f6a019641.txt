I am so disappointed. The Ahwatukee area is always desperately in deed of better dining establishments, so with this new glass walled and open restaurant my hopes were high for a nice new local establishment. While the menu looks pretty good (I think breakfast might be the only saving grace here) the lighting for dinner, the service and the food were all exceedingly below par.

On a positive note the wi-fi and power outlets are a great add on, but they need to fix the food and service part and then they could have a winner.
