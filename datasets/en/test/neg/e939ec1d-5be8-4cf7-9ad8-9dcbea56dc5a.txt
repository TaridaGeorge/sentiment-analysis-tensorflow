If you want your kids to get sick, or get pink eye you should attend this gym.  You can smell the germs the second you walk into this place.  With in one month 3 people that I know that attended this place walked away with a severe case of pink and thick snot  nose and a couch for 4 days.  We were perfectly healthy and we had not been anywhere else but this Gym.  Not even sure if they clean ever!!! The state needs to look into this. Awful place.
