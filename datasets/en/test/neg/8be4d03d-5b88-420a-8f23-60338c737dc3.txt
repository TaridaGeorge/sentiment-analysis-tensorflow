To crib from Star Wars, "You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."

"Hell hole" is hardly strong enough to describe what Arizona Mills has become the past few years. The sad thing is it used to be a great mall with a variety of both outlet and mainstream stores. 

Now it's filthy, run down, and overpopulated with wannabe hardasses. Many of the best stores have closed or relocated to other malls, the stores that do remain have crappy selection and mediocre prices, and the parking lot has become a wonderful place to have your vehicle dinged, damaged, or disappeared. 

Mall management clearly doesn't care about Arizona Mills anymore, so I figure neither should I.
