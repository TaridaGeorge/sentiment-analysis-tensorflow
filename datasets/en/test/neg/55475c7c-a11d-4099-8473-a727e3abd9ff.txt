We had lunch on the patio, which was completely lacking in charm - no view, no decor, not even a potted plant.  Mom enjoyed her Artisan Tuna Melt, but the Quinoa Salad she ordered never arrived, despite asking both our server and the person who delivered our food to check on it (both promised to check, but neither person ever returned to let us know status of that item).  My sister and I both ordered the Nicoise salad.  Unfortunately, both of our salads were missing 50% of the ingredients they were described on the menu to include.  We appreciated that they comped one salad to make it right, but it was still a sub-par dining experience.  With so many other good dining options nearby, we won't be going back.
