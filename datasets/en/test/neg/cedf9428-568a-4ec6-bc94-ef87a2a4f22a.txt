This store is difficult to get through, and most of the time, if I'm not desperately in the need for something, I avoid it. The only perk is the location for the people of Marley Park and surrounding neighborhoods. The staff is slow and VERY rude. Some of them will give you lip for asking for a receipt. Overpriced as well. Avoid if you can.
