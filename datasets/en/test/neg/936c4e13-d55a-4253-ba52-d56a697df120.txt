This guy came over to my house on Saturday to trim my 2 schnauzers.  I thought the first one looked good but when I got close, I could see that the grooming was uneven.  On my 2 schnauzer...poor dog.  A small white femail schnauzer.  He took off all of her hair and you can see pink skin.  He shaved her so close that she has razor burn and rash by her vagina and her anus.  She keeps licking it and she's shaking.  I'm worried that it will get infected and I will have to take her to the vet.  Going to PetsMart to see what they recommend.  I will be welcome to send you a pic of her razor burn to show you.  jk14me@aol.com
