Run for your life!!!  I needed to have so much stuff done to my bike when I had it towed in, needless to say they screwed it up so bad I have to have it towed elsewhere.  They have no idea what their doing.  The gas tank rusted so they took care of that, but only removed part of the rust.  The cleaned my carb....not, the carb was never touch...but I paid for all the service they refused to correct, and they paid triple the $$$ to get it drive able.  I bought my bike from them and have been treated like shit since.  Give your business to someone you can return to, stay clear of these clowns,,,fat momma with the food stained shit might come out and yell at ya....if she can put the fork down.
