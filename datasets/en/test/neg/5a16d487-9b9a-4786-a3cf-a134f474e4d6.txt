This man is a JOKE!!! Do NOT go to him.  Seriously, he will play into your fears and tell you that you need all this extra work to have a "healthy" mouth.  I went there for almost a year, and there was always new staff...the turnover in his office speaks volumes!  He will tell you that you need to have your teeth cleaned every 4 months.  What a joke?!!  Four months after he put a crown on a supposedly cracked tooth, I need a root canal.  And my new dentist said I never needed the crown nor did I need any of the other treatment that Espinoza tried to convince me I needed for a "healthy" mouth.  It's all BS.  He should have his licensed suspended.
