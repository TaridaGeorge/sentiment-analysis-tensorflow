I used to work for US Airways and I flew on them often because I flew for free.  If it wasn't for that, I think I would have flown any other airline.  The planes to hawaii are so old and beaten up, it's embarrassing.  Even most of the employees say that US Airways isn't great.  If US Airways is the cheapest, I would go with them, but if you are paying $10 more for Southwest, take Southwest.
