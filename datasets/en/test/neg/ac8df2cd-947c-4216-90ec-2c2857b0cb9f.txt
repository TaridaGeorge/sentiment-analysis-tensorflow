Although Hunan express took our delivery order 20 minutes before they closed, the food was half an hour late (after their 35 minute delivery estimate). The food was amazingly crappy. I ordered the Bok Choy Chicken, which was almost decent. My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken, which definitely made me want to throw up, first bite. Both were hugely lacking flavor.
