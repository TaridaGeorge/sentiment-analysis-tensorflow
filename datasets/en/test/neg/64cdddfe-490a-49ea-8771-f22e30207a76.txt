I came to chandler yr an half ago.. considering ashoka as the only option, I was a weekly visitor to this grocery shop..  you can expect a very rude behavior and expired products in this shop. 
I picked up Tomato Ketchup and noticed that it was already expired. I informed this to the person over the counter and he replied back saying its consumer's duty to pick the right thing.

Since he has to manage a big store, he cannot keep track of this on daily basis.  this statement was really rude and un-professional.

I never went back to ashoka after that. I figured out other options in Mesa and Tempe..
