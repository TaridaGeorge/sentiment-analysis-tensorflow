Dos Gringos is a bar about 8 years past its prime (as evident from the awards hanging on the wall that don't go past the year 2000).  It used to be my favorite bar to chill at on weekend nights and meet up with friends, but in the past few years the crowd has changed (for the worse), the cool & casual vibe went away, and the doormen became pushy and rude.
