Zero Stars! This place is a joke... The hotel looks like housing projects, the rooms are horrible! I lost money because I refuse to stay here and the general manager Ed was the most unhelpful piece of crap! He told me to stop whining and would not fix any of my issues. Stay a 1000 feet away this place should be condemned
