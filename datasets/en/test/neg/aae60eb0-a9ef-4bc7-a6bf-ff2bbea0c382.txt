Don't waste your money or your time here. We came in on a Thursday at 3:30pm and were the ONLY customers. Food is mediocre, prices too high, service HORRIBLE. We got orders at different times, the last orders coming out to us at 4:48 after most everyone had finished eating. When we said something when paying our bill, the woman behind the bar (who was quick to take our money) just argued and tried to justify that they only had one cook and we ordered pizza AND sandwiches on two checks, like it was somehow our fault. It was her chance to apologize and instead she chose to argue loudly. Lack of people skills is an understatement. We will NEVER set foot in there again and advise anyone against it also. I would rate this 0 stars if I could.
