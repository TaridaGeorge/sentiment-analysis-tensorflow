Very disappointed! I was told they aren't taking Plus size clothing anymore, some kind of corporate decision. I'm appalled! Why would you exclude an entire market?? A very stupid decision on their part and gross discrimination! Where are plus size women supposed to go to consign/buy nice clothing?  I would urge any woman who is or once was plus-sized to boycott this company!!
