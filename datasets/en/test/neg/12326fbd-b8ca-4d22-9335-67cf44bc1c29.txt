Not a very happy Grouponer!  I Used to like Daves, but the place is keeping odd hours and they are down to just 4 house brews. I stopped in today to redeem a groupon and was just flat out told NO. No explanation at all, just no and in such a way I crawled away. I will never return and plan to take up the matter wit Groupon inc. I feel they are ready to shutter the doors any time now, and that's too bad because I know they started with the best of intentions, excellent service, great food and awesome local brew.
