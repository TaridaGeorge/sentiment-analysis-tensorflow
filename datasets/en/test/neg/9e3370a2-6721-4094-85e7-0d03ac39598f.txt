What is it with this neighborhood? Every pizza place around here has horrible pizza. Thin crust means a delicious crust that's thinner than the regular crust. It doesn't mean a huge dry cracker. Any Italian worth her heritage wouldn't even walk on the same block as this Rosati's. Definition of Rosati's pizza:  cardboard crust, pasty sauce, and something beige that barely resembles cheese. They don't even know how to cut the thing. It's supposed be cut in wedges. The thing I brought home looked like a tic tac toe board. Ugh. So disappointing for someone who just moved into the hood.
