My family has been eating at China China for years. It used to be excellent, it has been going down hill the past couple times, but I thought I would give them one more try before giving up entirely. 
I called placed an order for House Special Egg Foo Young a Family fave, it is Shrimp, Chicken, Pork, Beef filled egg pancakes. There was one no meat, and we found one shirmp everything was tasteless. I also ordered pork fried rice, it was blah, shrimp chow mein was awful hardly any shrimp. The prices have gone up and the quality has gone way down.
I threw out the rice no one ate it, tossed out the chow mein also.. $30.00 down the drain. the take out buffet across the street is better.
