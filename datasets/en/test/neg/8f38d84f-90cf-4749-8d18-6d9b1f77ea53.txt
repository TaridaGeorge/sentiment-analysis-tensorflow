I am an artist...not so familiar with stamps.  The owner was EXTREMELY unfriendly and unhelpful.  Including eye rolling (on asking a question about the ATC group) and lots of pointing to where I could find items vs showing.  I asked if I could go behind the counter to look at a project for an upcoming class and was told, "NO!" It was so odd, I asked her if she was joking?  She said, "no, this is my space."  Never offered to take the item down to put on the counter so I could see....didn't matter.  I had already decided that an art environment is to be fun and inspiring...not a place to get yelled at.  I will always drive to Mystic Paper in Mesa or the Paper Store for a better atmosphere...better classes and prices!
