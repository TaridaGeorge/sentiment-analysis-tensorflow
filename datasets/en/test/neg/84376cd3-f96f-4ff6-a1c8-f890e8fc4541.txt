I love PPP but this location SUCKS. Avoid it. If you like their pizza as much as I do then go to the one on Williams Field and Lindsay (I think) as it's much better. 

This location for some reason has been off everytime. I had given them 4 chances but after the 4th and the taste being the same. That was it. No more.
