I really wanted to like this place.  For starters, I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told " we don't have enough change". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.  
     The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best. 
     Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili.
