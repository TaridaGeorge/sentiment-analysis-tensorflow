Not impressed at all! Rice is under cooked, crab puffs were inconsistent; either huge and super cheesy, or a tiny folded crisp. Shrimp tasted weird. The delivery guy kind of spilled the sauce so the bottom of the bag was drenched. Delivery speed was mediocre. Don't think I'll order from here again unless I'm desperate.
