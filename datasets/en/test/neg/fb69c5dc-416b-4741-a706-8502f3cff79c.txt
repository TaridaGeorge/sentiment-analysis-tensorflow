US Airways is probably the worst airlines I've ever flown on. But I swear they usually offer the cheapest tickets. I put up with the bad customer service, delayed flight times, horrible inflight service, and outdated planes just because of the cheap price of the airline ticket.

What sucks even more is I am a rewards member with them. I have enough to book a one-way flight but they do not allow you to book one way flights with your mileage points. You would have to be charged round-trip.  What's up with that! Once I have enough miles to book a round-trip flight I will do so and then hopefully never fly US Airways again.

I say only fly US Airways is if its the cheapest by far or a last resort.
