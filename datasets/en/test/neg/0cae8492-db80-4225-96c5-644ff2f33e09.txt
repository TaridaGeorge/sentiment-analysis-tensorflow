I guess I don't get it because I couldn't get over my friend having to use the bathroom in the kitchen! What?! Really?! That can't be right, or sanitary. We stayed anyway because of the great reviews. Wish I hadn't. It just didn't feel clean. The silverware is on the table, just hanging out in a little compartment on the table, probably seeing all kinds of coughing, sneezing, "kid hands" fun. I don't get the menu either. What kind of pictures and descriptions are those? I felt sick after I ate there and I am definitely not going back. Please try it if you want. I think the lesson to be learned here is "to each his/her own" because people seem to really love this place, so maybe the problem is with me ;(
