If I could give no stars I would. Mandatory $10 parking on game days is the ultimate insult and rip off. And the attendants taking the money are rude and surly. You'll feel like you are dealing with the mafia, which isn't far from the truth. I feel bad for the retail stores stuck in their contracts with this hell-hole. Do yourself a favor and drive up to Anthem or wait until the Premium Outlets in Chandler open in a few short months.

I was worried Tanger Outlets in Glendale would put the Anthem Outlet out of business. I'm not worried anymore.

Probably the biggest business fail in Phoenix for 2012.
