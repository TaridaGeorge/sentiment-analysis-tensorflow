I was in the neighborhood and stopped in today  with shopping on my mind.  I remember the store being crowded and full of bratty, screaming kids with non existent parents from before, but I still love a bargain.  I must be getting older or wiser or maybe I just don't have the need to buy used crap no matter how cheap the price.
I went to look at the shoes and the first pair I see are white (or used to be white) sandals that looked like whoever wore them last had wet dirty feet.  Too gross for me and I left and went to Marshalls.
I will never ever come back to this store again, lesson learned.  Most of the stuff you see here today will be at the swap meet tomorrow.
