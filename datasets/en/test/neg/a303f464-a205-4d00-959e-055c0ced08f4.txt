If you want to re-create this much-revered Phoenician favorite at home, here is a very simple recipe:

 1) don't buy fish
 
 2) find stale old breadcrumbs in your "cupboard" - form crumbs into a flat, oblong shape and insert into recycled oil from the last batch of fries you made (perhaps last year)
 
 3) slowly bring oil to a boil, cook until a soggy golden brown

 4) remove from oil and place onto an entire roll of BrawnyÂ®

 5) open food-service grade can of tartar slop. dunk fried oblong into slop, bite, chew, cry. repeat.

If you're a real seafood aficionado, throw some crusty horseradish into generic ketchup and dunk in there.

I've yet to find even a scrap of fish in an order of Pete's Fish n' Chips. The name is a lie.
