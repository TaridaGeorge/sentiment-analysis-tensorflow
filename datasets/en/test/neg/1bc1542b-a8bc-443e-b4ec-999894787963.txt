I prefer not to eat my prime rib wrapped in paper with plastic forks & knives... Refill on drinks are not an option, unless you get up for it... No kids menu... AND you have to clean you soaked through "paper" mess up yourself when you are done.. That's what the milk crate is for... For the price and taste I will go to Famous Dave's or try the new smokin BBQ next door... BTW - there was a hair in my brisket... Dinner for family of 4... Over $50... - best part, I didn't have to leave a tip!!  won't be back! Good luck!
