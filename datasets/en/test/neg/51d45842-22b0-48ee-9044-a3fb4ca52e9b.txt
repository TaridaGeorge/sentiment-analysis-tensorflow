Avoid this service shop. Took a tape player on for cleaning and service, the cleaned it mostly, changed 1 of the two belts that both needed replaced, then refused on multiple occasions to align the machine, no, I'm not kidding, the tech said he doesn't like to adjust things, so I spent hundreds on a machine that I had to do a full calibration when I got it back. THeir service is very bad, they will have your equipment for quite a while (3monthes for me), and it won't work when u get it back. I got very bad feedback about them after the fact from ALL the hifi stores in the area. Their techs also seem very untrained.  There are other Repair stores in Phoenix, use one of them.
