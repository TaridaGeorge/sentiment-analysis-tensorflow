OK-I realize this should not be a surprise.  But, in a stupor of holiday exhaustion, I ordered a Pan-Normous pizza for me and my kids.  My children, apparently already slaves to advertising, REALLY wanted to try it.  It turned out to be a good education for the difference between what something looks like on TV, versus real life.  ( I am sure there is a deep life lesson here, but I was too irritated to take advantage of it)  There was nothing enormous about the pizza, which is my main complaint.  I asked the guy on the phone how many people it would feed, he said 8.  Ummm-8 tiny people.  It was also, not good, but again, not surpised at that.  So I think I will be thankful that now my kids know how gross Pizza Hut is too.
