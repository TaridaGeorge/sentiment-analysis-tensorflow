This place has become really BAD since the owners changed recently. The dim sum beef which used to be great has become rubbery and the pork has lost all its flavor. We used to enjoy this place before, but now on a recent weekend visit we saw only about a quarter of the tables occupied. After the dim sum lunch, we figured out why. The dirty place and rude waitresses were tolerable because of the good food... not anymore when cold tough meat is served.
