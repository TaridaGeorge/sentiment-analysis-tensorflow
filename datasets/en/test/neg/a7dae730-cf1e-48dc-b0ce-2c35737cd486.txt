Burnt, bitter espresso. 

Bitterly disappointing. This place has so much potential, the pasties look yummy. I ordered my usual, an iced triple soy latte, to jolt me awake and fend off the morning headache. (Not iced in the winter.)

This was not drinkable. I will not be back.

Fair Trade Cafe, Lux, AJs,(even Starbucks), I am so sorry I cheated on you.
