It had been a year since our last visit to Old Spaghetti Factory.  What a difference a year makes!  My dinner was not too impressive.  Actually no one in our party of four was thrilled with their meal.  Very small portions and the food seemed like it was not even cooked fresh.

Don't think that we will be back any time soon.  I am pretty sad about that, as I have fond memories of OSF.
