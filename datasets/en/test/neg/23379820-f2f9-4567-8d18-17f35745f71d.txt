Short form:
ordered our food
(15 minutes elapse)
we get our iced teas
(15 minutes elapse)
the tables next to us that had ordered and were seated before we got there get SOME of their food, one sends soup back because it's cold.  
(15 minutes elapse)
45 minutes into this disaster, I ask for a refund and we leave 

Menu didn't look that appetizing, service was awful, and apparently what they served was poorly executed.  That's enough to keep me from ever going back.

(I should have written a review that takes 45 minutes to read, yet you get nothing from it.... kind of like going to Pomegranate)
