CUSTOMER SERVICE TOTALLY HORRIBLE. While the food is, let's say, OK (not the best despite the price that implies a superior product) the manager is coming directly from hell. 

Watch your credit card statement as mine was just double the amount of the meal and the merchant refuses to accept that there is a problem with it. 100% tip? Not on my receipt (which I thankfully I kept.) Thank you for the credit card protection mechanism against these vultures. Should send the Mystery Diners team there..
