The Douchebag black doorman having too high an opinion of his own self-importance refused to allow me entrance while my whole group where inside doing who-knows what, I never made it that far.

I AM semi-famous, I AM related to some VERY famous people, I graduated from Yale and have many friends famous that I can name drop, but to have this little man with his grandiose sense of importance pretend that he's better than all. Get over it, you won't see me ever spending my money here or entertaining my NYC guests. There are better places than this, and cooler dives that will treat you better in this economy, who appreciate the amount of coin I drop in their establishments.

I sincerely hope your supervisors read these reviews and can your ass simply because your ego is the problem itself. Karma is a bitch.
