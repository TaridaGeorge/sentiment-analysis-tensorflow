Friendly server but she was rather inattentive. Restaurant had dirty tables, but was in a nice, clean shopping plaza. The pizza lacked sauce and seemed, not only poorly, but a little inconsistently made. We didn't feel well after eating it, and I'm not surprised. Disappointed in this Pizza Hut experience!
