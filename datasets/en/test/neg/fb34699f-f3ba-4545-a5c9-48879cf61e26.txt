Okay with a name like BWW I knew they knew what they were doing aside the drinks from the bar.  They Sucked Big Time !!!  food was whack! as my wife explained it was a place to go to watch sports and drink beers and after a 6 pack anything taste good. Not the BWW I knew in California .... NEVER AGAIN ~ Spent almost $70.00 and felt robbed.
