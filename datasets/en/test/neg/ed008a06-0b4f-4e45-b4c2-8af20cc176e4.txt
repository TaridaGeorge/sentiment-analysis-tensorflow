WORST customer service EVER. Extremely rude and VERY unorganized! Will NEVER return! It amazes me how a small business like this would treat customers as they did me and my sister, maybe it was becuase we were women. They told us a different story everyday, about an item we ordered. We finally received it 4 weeks later! When we were told the day we ordered it it would be in the next day!!!! Plus you walk in to the place and there is just stuff EVERYWHERE just clutter and not very appealing at all.
