So, my husband and I have been in Arizona a little over a year and I've heard such great reviews for this place. So, for my husbands birthday I thought lets give it a shot. Well, the atmosphere was good,but that's it. The rolls and fry bread hard, the salad socked with dressing and not crisp and the chicken blah and lastly the steak would be better if I cooked it at home!! Nice view and atmosphere wish the food tasted better.
