The people in the valley have become too use to bad food. Their taste buds are non exsistant. I'm a pastry student, no not going to work in Az after graduation, so I couldn't care less about how popular this company is. A friend brought me some cupcakes from this place, with the exception of the dark chocolate cupcakes, they were NASTY. the coconut cupcakes tasted like flour; the strawberry had no taste; they were dense and heavy. A friend of mine, who has an iron stomach, had severe stomach pains. I'm not trying to be mean, but every single person that I gave a cupcake to, hated them. When my friend told me the price of a dozen, I almost choked on my tongue. These people are marketing gods if they can get people to think that they have quality product
