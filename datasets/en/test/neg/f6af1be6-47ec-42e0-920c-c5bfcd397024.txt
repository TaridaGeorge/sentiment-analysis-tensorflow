Tried Shorty's today, sadly it will be my one and only visit. To begin service was mediocre at best, portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider), and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger. That's when customer service went down the drain, all we got was a "that's weird" and an I'm sorry. If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back. Something, not just sorry for your luck. I will stick with RocketBurger, just up the street, cheaper, bigger portions, tasty and most important, they got great service. If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words I'd say"DON'T DO IT"!!!!
