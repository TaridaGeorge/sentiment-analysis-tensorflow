Holy poop, they are sooooo slow. They tell you it will take 20 minutes, and you're there for over an hour. The only chance you'll get fast service is if you're the only one there. They will also try to sell you extra crappy services you don't need (wait, everyone does this). However, they quoted me $70 (I knew I needed some extra crappy service), charged me $120, and then "did me a favor" by taking 20 bucks off. $100 for an oil change and changing light bulbs. That's very effed of you, jiffy lube. I should have given you the new bulbs back and gone to an auto parts store to buy my own d*mn bulbs. ARGH.
