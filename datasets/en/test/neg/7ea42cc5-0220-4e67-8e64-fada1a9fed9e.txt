Worst hotel experience ever. The rooms are dirty with wet stains on the carpets and dirt on the walls. The bathrooms are a joke - I've seen better at Motel 6. The beds are not comfortable and the walls are thin, so you get to hear screaming children day and night.

But what tops it all off as the worst hotel ever is the awful service. 2 hours and 15 minutes to get food (we never even got seated) because the Lobby Grill cannot stop checking their cell phones long enough to seat people. Coupled with the rudest desk managers (Zoey and Stephanie) and you have the worst customer service at a hotel ever.

Avoid this place at all costs! The water park is NOT worth the hassle of a place that overbooks and under serves.
