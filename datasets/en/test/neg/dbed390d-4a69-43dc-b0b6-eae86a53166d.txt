Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance. 

The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry.
