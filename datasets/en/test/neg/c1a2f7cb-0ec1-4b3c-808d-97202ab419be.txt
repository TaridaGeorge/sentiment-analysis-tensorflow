What is it with AZ and their TERRIBLE chinese?!  I'm from small town midwest and our chinese was amazing.  This is a big city- wtf?!  Anyways, Oriental Garden "super" buffet was anything but super.  I know that buffets in general are hard to rate becuase of the lacking food quality but I've had some great chinese buffets in my day.  The options are limited and they didn't even have the favorites like sesame chicken, general tso, or beef and broccoli!  Instead they replaced it with weird, questionable entrees like cheese covered seafood mystery.  Even the crab legs were bad and had a funky taste.  I wouldn't pay $5 for this buffet so the $13 a person is unresonable for the quality of food.  I'm sorry I can't think of any pros.

Will someone please tell where I can find good chinese food in this city????!!
