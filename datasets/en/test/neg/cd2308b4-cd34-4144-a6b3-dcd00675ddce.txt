I just bought a home in Arizona...  Nobody is living in the house.  First three month's bill are 100, 98, and 120...   The house is freakin empty with nothing in it, and that's the bill?   Turns out those are just the fees.  Only about 10-15 bucks of actual usage.   I think its time for politics to step in and regulate this company for grossly overbilling its customers.
