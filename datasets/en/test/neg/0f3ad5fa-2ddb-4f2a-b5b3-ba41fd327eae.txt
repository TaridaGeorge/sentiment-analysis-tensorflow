I also received a personal response from Joe, the owner. He offered to return my money since we were so disappointed with our visit. Although that isn't necessary, I understand everyone's tastes and expectations are different. Being a personal chef for many years, I look for originality, depth of flavor, and complexity of seasonings. BBQ sauces have a tendency to contain too much molasses and ketchup, which makes them too sweet.

We have a BBQ place here that offers six different sauces. You get to choose which one you want, but to me, if the meat's preparation has been given a great rub, no sauce is needed.
