Disappointment comes in small portions: I understand what they are trying to achieve. I understand they would like me to order 5-6 items, but I have no desire to spend anything over $50 for lunch. The sangria was the only morsel of hope for me to ever return. Having all the potential in the world, they could make this place fantastic. Considering my guest and I were the only ones eating in the middle of lunch hour I am positive that we are not the only ones who feel this way.
