It is very difficult to understand why there's a wait of 30 minutes at 11:30am at the Avis counter. And once i get the car and I get to the garage and there's a person there, it turns out they've triple booked the car and I have to go back to the counter and now they are struggling in finding any car. The result, an hour 15 minutes to get the car, late to meetings, not the type of car I had booked, etc. I always rent Hertz but today they were sold out. I've given a try at Avis but it will be the only one
