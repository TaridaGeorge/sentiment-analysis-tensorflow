Like other chains, Seasons 52 is impersonal and cookie cutter. Prepare for a long wait that isn't worth it... 50 mins waiting and that was with a reservation (first told they were 15 min behind on reservations, at 35 mins we were told they didn't know how much longer the wait would be even though guests arriving without a reservation were being told it was a 45 min wait). So first tip would be to just not bother with setting a reservation here.  

Though a nice menu selection and good flavor, the low cal gimmick is the hype and draw. Overall there are local chefs that are doing amazing seasonal and organic dishes with a more personal and attentive approach. They are far more deserving of our business than Season 52.
