Last Chance is not my kind of shopping experience!

The place is a crowded mess and definitely not for the claustrophobic.
Once you descend a steep staircase into the basement of a strip mall, you're faced with a big room jam-packed with racks of clothes and shoes, hordes of bargain shoppers (this was a Friday morning) and long lines at the cashiers. 
 
All of the casual shoes were priced 29.99, which is high for previously worn shoes. They were scuffed and even had dirt on their soles.  I've seen cleaner and cheaper shoes in thrift stores!

To me, Last Chance was a big turn off.  
Never again!
