I went to Crust last night and was very disappointed. I ordered the medium crust pizza with spinach as a topping. The pizza arrived lukewarm, and the spinach had a bitter taste. The service was friendly and the ambiance was OK, but I think that Joe's Pizza in downtown Scottsdale has a much better Sicilian stye of pizza for a much lower price. I will not be returning to Crust.
