I will NEVER go here ever again and it will be my pleasure to tell EVERYONE I know to do the same!!!!!!!! The bar is actually very nice and the bartenders are really chill. However, the security is horrible and power hungry. Whoever the tall skinny dude is with the beard and hat is a nut job and should be fired. He kicked me out after I went outside to check on my friend to see if she was ok.  Yes, her ID wasn't legit. However, how does that concern me? She was there before I got there, I didn't even go with her there. I just saw her there. They threw away my 8 dollar beer and wouldnt let me in. Screw this place.. Until they fire abe lincoln, i aint going there anymore.
