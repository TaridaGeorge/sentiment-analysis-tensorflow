Blech. The Good Egg my dupa! It's more like "The Bad Egg"! As someone who loves trying new places for breakfast food, the one and only time I have ever eaten here, I got sick. In fact, both the BF and I didn't feel good the rest of the day after eating omelettes from this crap-hole.

Every time I drive by this place (which is every single day because I live in the neighborhood) I say out loud, "Blech. More like the Bad Egg!" 

I don't know about other locations in the valley...but stay away from the one on 29th/Bell!
