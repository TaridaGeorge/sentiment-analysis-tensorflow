I've been to Jimmy's a few times and have given up on it.  The first experience was just really awful- like include salad with your order and wait twenty minutes for it to arrive awful.  (Nor were they really busy, so no excuse there.)

  The second time I ordered a sausage dish.  The crack brain trust that runs the place basically put it on a dish/saucer that wasn't big enough to move the thing about easily, so eating it was not as simple as you'd expect, nor was it a particularly memorable sausage.  The third time was the best of the three but they simply didn't have it in them to recover the interest and good will that earlier visits had cost them.

 Avoid.
