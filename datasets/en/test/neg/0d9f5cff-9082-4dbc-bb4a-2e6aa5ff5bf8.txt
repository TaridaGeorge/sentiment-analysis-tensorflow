6 years or so ago I would come to this mall every once in a while and I don't remember it being too bad.  Then again I was a college student new to Arizona and I may have just been naive.  The other day I walked in the front door and immediately starting planning how soon I could leave.  The place just has an over-run flea market atmosphere.  I noticed a few generic clearance stores, and with the Virgin Megastore going out of business I'm sure another one will be taking its place soon enough.  I stopped by a couple other "Outlet" stores where the prices were not very Outlet worthy.  

I should have just stayed away and kept the good memories intact.
