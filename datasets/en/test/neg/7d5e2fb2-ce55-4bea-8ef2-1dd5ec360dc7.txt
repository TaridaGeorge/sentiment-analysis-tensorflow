RA is awful. We've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant. No serious complaints about the food, but the service is just atrocious. I admit I'm mildly addicted to the ginger dressing they use on their side salads, but the methadone for that addiction is my abhorrence for the service. I will never go back here, but I may just convince my significant other to pick me up a side salad.
