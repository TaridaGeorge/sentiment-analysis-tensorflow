G-H-E-T-T-O!!!! They charge $5 on Fridays but the DJ didn't start until after 11:30pm and only had a jukebox!!!....they refused to serve tap water and we were told "the owner said we can only serve bottled water"....three people ordered and none received silverware....an alcoholic drink took so long my friend forgot she ordered it.....they refused to provide a receipt and stated "we don't give them out"....the crowd looked ROUGH....this place is a mess for Friday nights.
