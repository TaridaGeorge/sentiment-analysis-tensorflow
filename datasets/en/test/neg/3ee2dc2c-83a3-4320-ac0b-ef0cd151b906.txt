My son took his 1999 BMW R1200C in for head gasket repair, the cost $2500, within 2 weeks there was a rattling, as though a bolt was in something clanging around.  We took the bike in for a look see, now they are saying $1600 for a new drive shaft. We were williing to exchange a $6000 bike for a honda they had with the same mileage, which they had listed for $5200.  Their response, our BMW was only worth $1500. I have the Kelly blue book price on both bikes. What are they thinking. We just want them to put it back together the way it was when we brought it in, so that we can take it to a more admirable repair shop.
