Seriously...I can't make this stuff up..a blonde chick (an employee at the restaurant) with her feet up on the bar with her gnarly converse shoes was our first visual walking into Genghis Grill...then my daughter heard her say as we were standing at stand waiting for somebody to greet us..."My shift is over they are just going to have to wait"..I am glad my daughter told me the comment she made after we had left...anyway the food station was a mess...our actual  "server" was nice enough but we will not be going back...the location near paradise valley mall is much nicer and cleaner!!!
