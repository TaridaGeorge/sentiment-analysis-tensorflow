Don't do it. Don't even think about moving here. 
It's not safe, it's not nice to look at, parking sucks, and the management is awful. Our laundry room flooded on several occasions and getting maintenance to come by was an absolute struggle. The water was turned off at 8am-11am on 3 different occasions without warning. So when it was time for us to be up and showering for work, we couldn't even brush our teeth!! My car got towed in regular uncovered parking for having the tags two weeks expired. 
One week from moving out a guy got pistol whipped by the dumpsters where everyone has to park. 
I'm pretty sure I've made my point, so I'll stop before a vein pops out of my head from having to think about this hell-hole.
