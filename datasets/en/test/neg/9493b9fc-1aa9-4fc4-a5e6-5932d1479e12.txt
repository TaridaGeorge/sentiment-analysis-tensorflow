A little late to the party.  I was able to convince my father to get out of this house for what looked to be a great time and great food.  What a DISASTER.  The prior reviews are dead on.  We were so excited to savor the tastings of food trucks but obviously so was the entire population of Scottsdale.  Lines lasted for hours, trucks ran out of food and everyone was grumpy.  Not impressed.
