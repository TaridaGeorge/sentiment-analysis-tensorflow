Don't go to NYBB! The staff is is incompetent & lazy. Told the counter person I had never been there before. They literally walked away without saying anything. They didn't offer any suggestions/help/explanations. My order was wrong when I got it. Because it had the wrong condiments it tasted disgusting. NYBB is extremely overpriced. Do not go to NYBB!
