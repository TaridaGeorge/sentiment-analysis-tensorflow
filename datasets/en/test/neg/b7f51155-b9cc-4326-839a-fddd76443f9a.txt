The theater itself I have no problem with. Its the fact that we came out of the theater to a broken out driver passenger window, my doors unlocked and some Dumb Ass broke into my car and didn't even take anything. Really?? 
I should've known better given the area but it was the only Harkins showing the movie we wanted to see. Security was nice enough to leave a note on my window.Can you believe there's No Cameras in the parking lot at all!! Ugh!!! Disappointed customer to say the least. Will not be back there that's for sure.
