I  won't eat bagels in Phoenix, so I am not here to review them.  I am only here to say that I had dinner there last night and the place is filthy.  The service awful, at best.  The Reuben sandwich small, flat, greasy, not enough dressing.  The partitions between the booths are so high, that you can't see a server and they can't see you.  I had to wave my napkin high over the wall to get noticed.  And it's not like there were any other customers to serve.  A complete waste of time and money.
