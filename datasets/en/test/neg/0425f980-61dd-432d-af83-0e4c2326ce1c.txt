this is one of the old building.
the carpet is sticky and the room is smelly.
if you are looking for a decent place to hit, this ain't it. they need to fix the interior and rip all of the carpet. making it a bad name for hilton.
other than the room, all standard hotel service.
but again, the carpet and the room is bad.
