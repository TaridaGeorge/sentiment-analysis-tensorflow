this place sucked u walk in cash only had to go to chevron and pull money out biggest mistake i should have stayed out so its $6.95 with a drink and you have to get ice tea to get refills all the good ones u have to pay (not that the others were any better) another $1.40 (retarded) the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken (WTF) seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return
