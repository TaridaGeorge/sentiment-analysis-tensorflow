I'm sorry Target....  I really love you, but this location needs new management.  This particular Target is near my office and I occasionally run over during my lunch break to pick up a few items.  Over the past month, 3 out of 5 of my trips have resulted in me abandoning my cart at the checkout lanes.  Seriously?  Lines that reach the jewelry counter???  Open up another lane for goodness sake, 2 is obviously not enough.  Ugh, probably won't be returning to this location.  Ever. Again.
