This is NOT NY PIZZA!

I came here only once for lunch, and tried the pizza here for the first time. 2 slices of sausage, and a dinner salad. Both slices were thicker than your basic delivery chain pizza. The pizza was very thick crust, puffy and chewy, and the sausage was little balls of meat that tasted like it was from a frozen pizza. 

Overall the pizza was NOT very good!

This place should never call itself a NY Pizza joint. Thick crust IS NOT NY PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!! 

Wow it's truly is a crime to call this NY Pizza!
