The food here is awful.  I live next door so I thought I would give it a try.  When I was given a menu I was told that the prices were incorrect.  I ordered a combination plate and was charged $4 more dollars than what the menu price was making it $10.  Not sure if they tell that to everyone or just me?  Thought it was a little steep for a hole in the wall Chinese place.  I would have been ok with the price if the food was good, but this was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted.  Everything was bland.  And I wasn't sure what the meat was (chicken, pork, pigeon, rat).  Even the fried rice was bad.  Avoid this place and go to Pei Wei up the street.  The food is a million times better and less expensive!
