Not the best food. We had both American and Vietnam food. The pho is sub par at best (the meat was gross) and the burgers were over cooked. Looks like a great place to have a drink and party but not good to eat. We had a groupon so that was the only reason we went. Listen to the reviews and do not eat the food!!!
