Very disappointed in this branch's service. New to the area. Stopped in to find a few books. Stopped at the front desk to ask where to find something but they ignored me but served those behind me in line instead! This was early afternoon and I came dressed for work and am very presentable. What gives?
I also wanted to use a computer to look up a book. All were in use. People surfing the net and sitting there forever. I couldn't look up the book and finally left.
If you want service or the ability to actually look up a book then this is NOT the library for you. If you want to sit and surf the net then I recommend this branch.
