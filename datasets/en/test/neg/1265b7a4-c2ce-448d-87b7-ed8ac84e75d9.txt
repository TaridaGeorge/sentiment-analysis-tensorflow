Top ranking in unknowledgeable employees and horrible customer service. I came in to get a base spray before a wedding and somehow got upsold to a monthly membership. It doesn't include the spray tanning and I don't bake in beds. I asked at the time if I could cancel, they said at any time. They forgot to mention you have to come in to fill out paperwork and can't do it via phone, and even though I have NEVER ONCE used the beds they wouldn't refund the fee. 

Not impressed and won't be back.
