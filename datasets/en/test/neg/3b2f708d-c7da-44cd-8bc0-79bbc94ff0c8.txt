Broke a pair of perscription sunglasses at the hinge.  Costco referred me to this place.  They did the repair by afixing new temples.  When I got them out into the sun, they didn't match the frames...the frames were black so it wasn't like it was some freaky color or pattern to match...just black.  When I took them back in to remedy the situation I was informed it was the best that they could do.

A few weeks later the screw came out of the hinge, so I took it back.  I was informed that the policy of the store was not to do any repairs without charging for it....even resetting a screw, which I supplied.  

How much could it be to reset a screw you might ask? Would you believe $20.00!  I prefer to select who I let screw me, and this dump ain't one of them....
