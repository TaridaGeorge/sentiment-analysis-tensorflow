So I'm in there yesterday and I walk by a young guy who greets me with Hi how are you today.  I politely, nicely, say "fine thanks" but --OMG-- neglect to ask him how he was.  Apparently this was a major issue for him so he decided to mutter something like, "I'm fine, thanks,"  even though I didn't ask and frankly didn't care.  I turned back to look at him again and he was grinning like the smart-assed bastard that he is.  Good service and hiring, guys.  This place sucks.  Just for identification purposes if anyone from Fresh & Stupid reads this, he had brown hair, is probably 19 or 20 years old, and had those big stupid earrings (I guess the kids call them "guages") in his ears.
