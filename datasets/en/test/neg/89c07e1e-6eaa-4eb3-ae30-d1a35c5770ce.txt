I took my cat, Moe, to get a haircut at this Petsmart. He's a total fuzz ball. So I drop him off and head down the road with a friend for dinner. 

About 30 minutes later, I get a call from some kid there that there's been an emergency and that I needed to get there immediately. Freaking out, I get there in 3 minutes, only to find my cat in the corner of the store hissing with a couple of employees scared to go near him. Afraid of a 10 lb, claw less, half shaved cat. Isn't that their jobs?

In the end, my cat had a weird mullet and then to even it out, he ended up getting shaved and looked stupid for a month.
