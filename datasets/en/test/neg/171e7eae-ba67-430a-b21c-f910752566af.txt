Thank God this place went out of business! I went in there one day and chatted up the owner a bit before ordering. It was about 3 in the afternoon and no other customers were around. I asked if I could get a half sandwich and the owner rudely asked what I expected him to do with the other half! Is he THAT stupid or just a smartass!
