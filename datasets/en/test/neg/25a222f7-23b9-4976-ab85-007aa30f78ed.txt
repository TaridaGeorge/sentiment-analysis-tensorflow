There 2 good items at Ketzal.  1.  The bar!  Good selection of Tequilas.  2.  The chips and salsa sampler.  (Which is not complimentary anymore).    You have to seat yourself.   The waiter and waitress both missed on the bringing us water after we requested it.    My wife went to the bar to get water.    A third waiter brought us the water.   The drink order was wrong, but if you like free drinks......   The rice and beans are bad.  They were not even hot. Do not come here for the food.   I hope Ketzal gets a new chef before they open at 101 and Tatum.
