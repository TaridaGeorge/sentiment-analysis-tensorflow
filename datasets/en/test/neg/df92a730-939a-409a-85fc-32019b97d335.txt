If you want a cheap, crappy nail job go to Van's. Complain all you want. It can hurt from to much filing, they can leave bubbles in your nails, and they can file them square when you want them round.. What can you do about it? Nothing.. Unless you speak their language, which I unfortunately did not. (Yes I'm another dumb American).

There are thousands of jobs that do not require one to speak English, but I do not feel this is one of them. Communication is key in the service industry. They seriously brought tears to my eyes 3 times and my nails looked horrible. I will not return.
