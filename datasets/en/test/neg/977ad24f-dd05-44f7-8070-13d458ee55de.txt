I have frequented unlimited coffee for many years. The coffee, gelato, and comfortable seating was great. Now the coffee shop allows no outside food (even a partially eaten hot dog) and has jacked up the prices for soft drinks to close to 4 bucks, and hounds people as they walk in to place an order. I recently went to order coffee with a friend, we had placed our order, and then i was told my partially eaten hot dog in an enclosed container was not allowed. We left and went to Lux Coffee and had an enjoyable time. I even got to finish my hot dog. Unlimited Coffee use to be a cool coffee shop.
