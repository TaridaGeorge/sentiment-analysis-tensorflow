uck   apparently JOEY IS NOT from CHICAGO~~~~~~ Al's  & Portillos are still the BEST
Joey put tons of pepper on the sandwich  burning our lips--hour later & my lips still hurt 
 --bread was OLD & dry - had wrinkles!!! -which is a sure sign of old bread product----even 'dipped' it was tough~~~ it was our 1st time & we will NEVER go back --
-I gotta stop falling for that old line 'just like Chicago'
 please don't waste your money!!!
