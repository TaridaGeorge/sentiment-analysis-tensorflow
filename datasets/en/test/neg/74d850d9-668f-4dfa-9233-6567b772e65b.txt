My boyfriend and I went to meet up both of his sisters here last night and had the rudest bartender. She must have been having a horrible day but the service industry is definitely not suited for her. This Zipps is a great location but I won't be back after being treated so horribly. We rang up a large tab and I was hoping his sisters wouldn't leave a tip because she really didn't deserve one with all the scowls and glares we received from her. She got her tip but we won't be back. Not a way to treat your customers!
