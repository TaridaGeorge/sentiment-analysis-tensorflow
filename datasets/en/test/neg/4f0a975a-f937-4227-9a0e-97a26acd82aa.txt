Do not go to Aspen Dental! I went here because it was covered by my insurance and I had a horrible experience. The assistants did not know how to take X-rays and had to re-do them all. It is not fun getting dental x-rays as they stick a bunch of metal objects in your mouth....twice is even worse. I needed a bunch of work done and I later found out that it was done poorly and I had to get it re-done. The dentist at Aspen Dental who did all of the substandard work is no longer employed, however, that doesn't help me now. It is a corporate chain and I highly dicsourage you from going there. The smaller dental practices are the way to go!
