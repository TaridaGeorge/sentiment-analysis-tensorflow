I was on vacation in Scottsdale and decided to go to the movies. Ultra Star Cinema double charged my card at the consession stand. When I called to inquire about a credit, the night manager would not credit me the second overcharge. Then she took my name and phone number (most likely to brush me off) and never returned my call with a resolution. 

I find it completely unethical to take a consumers money without reason and unprofessional not to return a promised call. Do not use this theatre they will scam you out of your money, literally.

Horrible customer service.
