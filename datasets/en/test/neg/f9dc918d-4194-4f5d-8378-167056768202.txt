Sign on door "Monday through Saturday, appointment recommended." I walk in on a Saturday, look at two dresses and was quickly approached by a sales woman.  "Do you have an appointment?" Me: "No, just looking" Woman: "Oh, well you can't. You need an appointment on Fridays and Saturdays."  I'm sorry, don't put a sign on your door that says recommended, when you HAVE TO HAVE ONE! Not to mention, the tongue piercing on the sales woman. Wouldn't want to buy a wedding dress from that person... Oh well, they won't be getting my business or any of my friends' business. Try better, Almond Tree... Plus, the scan of the dresses I got was MEHHHHHHHHH
