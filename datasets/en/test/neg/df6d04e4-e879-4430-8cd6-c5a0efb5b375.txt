Very poor service. When it was made evident we were waiting for the happy hour, our waitress barely paid attention to us. We ordered food in the meantime, so it's not like we weren't worth her time. 

The food was ok, but not good enough or enough of it to justify the price. 

There are better options near by where you can get better food, better service, and more bang for your buck.
