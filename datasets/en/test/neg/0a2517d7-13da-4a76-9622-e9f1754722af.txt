First of all it's $14.50 for a bowl of pho' . that's way over price.  The soup was disgustingly bland and the one of the owners was walking around like a vietnamese hitler runway model, pacing back and for in the restaurant.  The interior decor was dark and reminded me second hand IKEA store.  I would never come back here and if you're smart take your business elsewhere.  You been warned.
