Used a groupon prepaid copon for dinner.  Service was very good; after that not so good.  Food was luke warm and the salad was just average.  The Gyro plate was greasey and bland.  For $9.00+ it should have been much better.  I have had Greek food at many places and this one is at the bottom of the list.  I would pass on this one.
