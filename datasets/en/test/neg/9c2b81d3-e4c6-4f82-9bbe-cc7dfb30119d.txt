We went to this park in hopes of giving our dog Buffy a good experience outdoors. This was not the case at West Chandler Bark Park. Here's the scoop:

-This park is tiny compared to Shawnee and Paseo bark parks also in Chandler

-No one was there on a Saturday afternoon except for three guys

-Of those three guys one did not have the consideration to tell his stupid dog to stop jumping on my husband and I who were sitting on a bench. That dog kept messing with our dog, messing with us and it got to the point where the owner finally got off his butt, pulled his dog away from us and instead of apologizing he said "Do you guys have dog treats or something?" What a moron. 

Check out Paseo if you're in Chandler, this park will impress you and your dog:
