10 minutes before closing time they have all the chairs upside down on all the tables and the lights down. Walked 10 minutes to order take out. I can't tell you how this experience would have been due to the customer service issue. 
Won't happen again ! This left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even taste the food.
