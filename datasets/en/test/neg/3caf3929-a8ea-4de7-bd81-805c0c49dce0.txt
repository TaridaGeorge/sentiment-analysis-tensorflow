Looked like a very nice place to eat so we thought we would check it out one night. All was fine until we got our food. I ordered filet mignon well done because that's how I always like my steak and a friend ordered a steak as well only medium well. Well we both got our steaks and they were very rare and blood was pouring out when we cut into them. Disgusting! I sent mine back and when it came back out to me it was charred so bad I couldn't eat the outside of it. They need to get a better chef!
