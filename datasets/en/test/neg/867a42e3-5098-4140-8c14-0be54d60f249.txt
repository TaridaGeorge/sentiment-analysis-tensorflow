I guess I had the same experience Shawn did.  I called and got a very nice and courteous person on the phone.  I believe it was Martin.  He told me he would stop by and give me an estimate and that was the last I heard from him - 4 weeks ago.  I guess he wasn't too interested in maintaining my yard.
