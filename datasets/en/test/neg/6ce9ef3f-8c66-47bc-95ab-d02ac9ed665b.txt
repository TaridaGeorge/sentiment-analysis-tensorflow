way to go Macayo's, thanks for ruining my birthday meal.  I had hundreds of choices, and sadly, i chose you :-( 

after 45 minutes of waiting for our food, i practically begged somebody else's waiter to either find our food, or find our waitress.  a few minutes later, our waitress comes out and says that they "can't find one of the plates".  

what?  after 45 minutes they realized they have a ticket dangling there, right in front of their faces, and they "can't find one of the plates"?  we both ordered off of the 'summer specials' menu.  you know, the one you charge double for.

needless to say, we walked. Mi Patio on 3rd Ave/Osborn was much better, and much cheaper anyway.  and they let ol' BobbyQ know that they not only appreciated my business, but that they appreciated my birthday.
