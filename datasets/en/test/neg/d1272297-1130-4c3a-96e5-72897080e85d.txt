So I came in for happy hour-my first time here- sat at the bar and was ignored by the arrogant bartender. When I finally asked if they had champagne he made some snarky comment then continued his snotty arrogant tude t/o my time at the bar. Needless to say I will never be back I couldn't get out fast enough!!
