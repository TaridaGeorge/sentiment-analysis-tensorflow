I don't know who would be so hard up to purchase these 80's looking, too high priced, cheap clothing from the tight wad who owns this place.

I went in to sell  a two season past, hip, light gray Oscar twin set  that was in excellent condition and they wanted to give me $8! I asked to speak with the manager and the owner was there and she told me that I can take my business elsewhere after I told her that she was crazy for asking $30 for a long length, highly padded blazer from the 80's. I asked anyone in the store if they wanted to make me an offer on the way out. I'm glad that I donated it to a place where she can't get her hands on my things---The owner most likely sends her staff to Goodwill to stock her store.
