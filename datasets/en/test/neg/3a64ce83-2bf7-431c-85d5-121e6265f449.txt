bland.  dry.  underwhelming burger.  sure they have many options but so does fuddruckers and fuddruckers is crap as well.  chicago hamburger co is where it's at.  

spent 20 for girlfriend and i ate original hamburger works and won't be doing that again anytime soon.  and that burger was not 1/2 pound.  the only good thing was that they had red cream soda.  by far the most disappointing place i;ve been that i heard about via this website.

thanks for misleading yelpers.  this place doesnt believe in seasoning.

btw.  chili fries tastes like carl's jr's.  100% crap.
