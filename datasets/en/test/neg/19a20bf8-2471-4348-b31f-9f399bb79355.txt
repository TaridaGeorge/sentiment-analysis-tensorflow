Are you kidding me? I went to this place for lunch last week as I was waiting for my appointment with the no so genius staff at the Genius Bar at the Apple store down the road.... Thats another story... But I digress.... Anywho, This place absolutely sucks... Indian buffet scares me anyway, but this place takes it to a whole new level....The Naan was dry, the was a choice of almost nothing in the buffet... I almost walked out, but since I was there and wanted to review, I couldn't accomplish my mission without taking my life in my hands and trying it.... Good news, I'm still alive.... Bad news is, I am losing faith that good indian food exists in the valley
