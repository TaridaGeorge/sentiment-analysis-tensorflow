....you get the idea.

Took about 20 minutes to just get water. We were considering eating here, despite their limited vegetarian (ahem, make that... non-existent) options but since getting waited on seemed like waiting in line at Walmart, we left. We were going to stay, my giflfriend was going to eat while I nibbled on something bland and boring since I'm a vegetarian. But nope. Gone... we left... so starving.
