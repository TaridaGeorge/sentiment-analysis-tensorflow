I often use Yelp while traveling to find good local restaurants.  Hence, when I found the positive reviews for Rosie's, I had to try it out.  Well, in the hopes that others do as I do (by reading review), I'd skip this establishment.  

I ordered the fish and chips, which is the house special.  When I see "house special" I figure they've got to do that one right.  

Nope.  I kept thinking of Robert from the TV show Restaurant Impossible, and how he'd feel eating mushy fish in a greasy batter covered coating, laying on top of soggy fries.  In addition, I can't think of how anyone can mess up coleslaw.  Well, with limp greens sitting in day old (or older) sauce, that's how.

Washing it down with a pint of beer was the best I could do.  My recommendation is to continue searching for another venue on Yelp.
