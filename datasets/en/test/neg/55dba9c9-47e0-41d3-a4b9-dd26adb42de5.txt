This place is so frustrating. Its such a great lounge with a great atmosphere and look. Not to mention the DJ's and music they pull into that place is usually amazing localites. UNFORTUNATELY, this bar does not really understand how to market itself nor how to promote. If you plan on having a drink and wanting to be ALONE you will definitely get it most nights of the week. Drinks are ok.
