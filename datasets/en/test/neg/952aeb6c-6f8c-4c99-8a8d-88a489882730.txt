I'm so disgusted that this place is associated with the Original Pancake House chain.  I've been to this restaurant in Chicago, Wisconsin, the old one at Greenway in Phoenix and even the original one in Portland Oregon.  All those were great restaurants.  This one sucks.  Crappy service, cash only policy, cell phone policy geared to appeal only to the extremely old, and cramped seating ( you are like 2 inches away from the next table) ruin this place.  The food doesn't even match up the quality of food normally found at OPH.  My advice-- eat at an OPH at some point in your life, just not this one.
