Very dissatisfied with the customer service...

I frequently eat at smash burger and every time I order half regular fries half sweet potato fries and it has never been a problem. Today on the other hand, the manager explained that it was difficult to be done and tried giving me a lecture. It made me feel as if I were an inconvienence. 

 IT'S ALL ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE, an additional amount if necessary would of been fine. 

I WILL NEVER GO BACK and speak all negative things when asked. 

Smash Burger, I expect a response if you would like to rectify this situation and have a good patron return.
