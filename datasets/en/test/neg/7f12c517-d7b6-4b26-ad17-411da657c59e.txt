I am not sure if I went on an off day or what.  My omelet was less than mediocre.  My in-laws had sandwiches that came in regular sliced white sandwich bread, yuck! My husband had another omelet and he didn't finished his either.  My friend keeps asking me to go there with her, but I am too traumatized.
