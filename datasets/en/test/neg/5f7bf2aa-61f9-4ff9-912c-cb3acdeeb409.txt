Yikes.. I should have checked the Yelp before going here for my FIRST EVER CRAB LEGS EXPERIENCE. Is this place specifically designed to annoy? As we sat there eating very mediocre crab (it's not supposed to taste really fishy right?), the volume of the music doubled and all of the employees line danced to "COTTON EYED JOE" by Rednex which is possibly the most annoying song of all time. This lasted roughly two minutes and was followed by a Smashmouth song. To add to the annoyance factor, there are multicolored Christmas lights strewn throughout the restaurant and the staff wears tie-dye shirts. Thinking about it is giving me a headache. Would maybe go back as a joke. The hush puppies were good.
