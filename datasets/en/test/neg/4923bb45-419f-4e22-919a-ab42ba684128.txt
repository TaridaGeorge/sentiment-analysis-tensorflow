This place looks nice when you walk in, but don't expect any customer service. I've been in twice to use a computer during my work day and both times I've had both printer issues as well as employee incompetency issues. The people there don't seem to think they need to help you and would rather sit behind the counter chatting. When I finally got someone to come over to help they made the problem worse and ultimately resulted in taking an insane amount of time trying to get refunded for their mistakes which they wouldn't even apologize for. 
Ps James, member since 06... you'd think you'd learn how this stuff works by now. Also, your a jerk.
