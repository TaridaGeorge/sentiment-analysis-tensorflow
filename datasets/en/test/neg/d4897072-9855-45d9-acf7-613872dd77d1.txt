Stopped in recently for the first time since the new owners took over. Management staff and food has changed and not in a good way.  It seemed like the food is not as flavorful as it used to be and the staff spends more time with each other then with their customers. The menu hasn't changed much but the quality of the food and ingredients seem like they have.   It took me over 15 min to order a drink at the bar, the bartender and manager spent way to much time flirting with each other. It  seemed like the environment turned into the staffs own private playground. Why fix something that wasn't broken bring back the old staff, bands, and cooks before its to late.
