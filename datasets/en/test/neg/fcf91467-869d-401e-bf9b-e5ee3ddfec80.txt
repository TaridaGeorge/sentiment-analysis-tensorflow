This place gave me the poops. I wasn't gonna be so direct but someone else in here said it gave them stomach pains, so I thought I'd throw it out there. I had a cheese pizza. The plainest pizza available, and it made me poop out of my ears.

This Rosati's does not taste as good as other Rosati's - I've eaten at the location in Maricopa, which is AWESOME, and a couple of locations in the Chicago area, which are inherently awesome. I notice that there are two Rosati's websites: rosatispizza.com and myrosatis.com. I don't know why, but the good Rosati's I have been to are under rosatispizza.com, and NOT myrosatis.com. They both have different locations listed.
