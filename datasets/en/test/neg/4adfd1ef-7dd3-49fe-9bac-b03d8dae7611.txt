Rude! The man working here today had no interest in my business. I simply wanted to ship some documents, but instead of outlining options or helping me he just pointed at a display of envelopes and said I had to buy those first. When I grabbed a single express envelope he just said I couldn't use that instead of explaining that I could use that to ship express. When I said i would go to a UPS store instead he just said "yeah" and walked away. Horrible customer service- I won't be back to this location!
