Pretty annoyed with this place.  Only reason I am ok with giving them any stars, is they had Kiltlifter on tap, otherwise i would strongly campaign for a zero star review.  I got the "Miss Priss" it tasted like sour garbage. Mushy, warm, sour garbage. How do you mess up a turkey sandwich???  YUCK.  My friend got the "Hawaii chicken", he quickly named to vomity badness. the chicken breast was brown.... not dark meat, BROWN. I was going to take my leftover 3/4 of a sandwich and give it to a homeless person or something, but i didn't want to make they're day any worse... So long story short, if you wanna go spend 13.50....17.00 with tip, spend that money somewhere else because mill is popping off with waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy better places than this. chronic tacos next door looks interesting and the munchies deli as well.
