I had used this company when I lived back in Tucson for a one-time pest issue, and although they were expensive they took care of the issue. Now I live in Scottsdale, and needed help with another pest issue here. I called this office and the representative, Kelly, proceeded to explain that they never do one-time services. I asked if they are the same company as the one in Tucson (which they are according to their website) and she just said "this is Phoenix".  Rude, rude, rude and obviously not interested in new customers.
