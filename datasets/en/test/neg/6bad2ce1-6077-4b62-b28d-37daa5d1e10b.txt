Dealt with this listing agent as a buyer of a property he was representing.  Agent lacks in professional communication, and appropriate avenues in which to do business.  

For example, he contacted my mortgage company to initiate pre-qualification and property appraisals prior to the home being under contract (he was furnished with a pre-qualification letter during the offer process).  Another example, he contacted my mortgage company to determine if I was still interested in the same property instead of submitting a formal counter offer to my Agent who, concurrently, was in constant communication with him.
