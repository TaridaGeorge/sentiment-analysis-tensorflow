I I would really like this place had they not treated me like crap!! And I will def. not spend money on a place where people do not appreciate it. Even if it is only $10 I am spending. 

I requested the pasta renaissance and explained that I'm a vegetarian and that the sauce needs to be the one not being soaked with meatballs.

Well the chick behind the counter says'' if you 're a vegetarian you need to  order something else''

it took a lot out of me to not say really mean things. 

I have requested this before with no problems, so I am not sure what happened that day, but regardless I have no desire to go back.
