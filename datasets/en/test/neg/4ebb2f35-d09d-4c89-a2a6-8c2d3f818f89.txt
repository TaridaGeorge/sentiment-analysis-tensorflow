Super rude!! The guy who gave me a haircut, Philip, is definitely someone who shouldn't be in this line of business if he doesn't know how to be courteous to his customers. He snapped at me (oh yes..he did) for taking an extra minute to explain what i wanted and said that I wasn't being clear. And then later in the guise of making conversation he commented about a child who came in saying that that child sounded possessed! I should have walked out. I regret not having done that.
This is it for me..no more super cuts ..ever! Done!
