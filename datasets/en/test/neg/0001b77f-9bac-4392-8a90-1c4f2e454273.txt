Place got great reviews on Yelp, so we stopped in on our way to work one morning.  

Service was slow.  The food took so long to make (over 30 minutes) we had to have then pack our sandwiches to go!  They were sandwiches and salads!!  Why the hell did it take 30+

Finally upon eating, I was still confused, why is this place so good?  I would rater get a Panera Bread sandwich, or go somewhere else than stop back in here.  

Sorry, friendly service can't help cover up a slow prep/delivery time and mediocre food.
