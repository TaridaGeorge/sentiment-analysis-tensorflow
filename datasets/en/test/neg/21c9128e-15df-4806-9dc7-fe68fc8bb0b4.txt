i wish i could really drop a big fat zero star at here. went there with friends, he said he used to be a regular customer there. but whatever. walk in, seeing all the girls who workec there just playing relax n chattin with ppl like they are not apart of hooters. got seated n spent 15 mins to just to see our waitress playin with others then came to us n got us drink. quite frankly. u really have to dress to impress in order to get ur waitress an attention. me n my buddy were dressed like a small kids. and what next? i dont have to tell u n u may already what was up. we sat there 2 hours with the drinks we ordered when we started.
