Their coffee isnt entirely convincing, the place is more style than substance (and flavor for that matter). The place isnt big enough and unfortunately I stopped going to this place because it seems to me, given my different experiences at this place, that minorities arent welcome here given the treatment of some of its staff and patrons. Unfortunately, at such time we didnt have any other alternative but Starbucks, until Lola's Coffee opened and welcomed us with open arms. Glad to say I have never looked back. 
But putting their demeanor aside, their coffee isnt the best for the exorbitant prices you pay.
