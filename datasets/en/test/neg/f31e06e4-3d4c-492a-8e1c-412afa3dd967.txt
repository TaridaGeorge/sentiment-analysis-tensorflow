I would never go here again or even bother spending a penny at this establishment. Went to 2 local scooter shops today to look at scooters because I was interested in purchasing one. The man here was the rudest and most obnoxious person I have met in a long time. He didn't want to give any information about manufacturers, quality, warranties, or anything. He couldn't even be bothered to get off his stool. When I tried asking questions, he became hostile in tone and manners. I actually FLED this place. Went to Scooter Invasion in Tempe and they were wonderful. Took time to give information and brochures and no hard sell. Didn't buy a scooter today because I was comparing models but I will NEVER GO BACK to Performance Scooter. My money will be spent at their competitors.
