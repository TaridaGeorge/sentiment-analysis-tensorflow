westgate has great resturaunts & layout but no bands or good music at night unless you are into the music  & lifestyle that my high school children are into.  if you want late 80,s & 90,s music & entertainment you need to head to cental  phx. or scottsdale. ocassonally  j. buffets margaritaville has good rock on sat. nights but usually does not start untill around 11 p.m.and better call first because it is not allways there.
