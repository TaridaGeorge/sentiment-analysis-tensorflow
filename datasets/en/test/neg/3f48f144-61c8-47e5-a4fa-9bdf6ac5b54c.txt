A complete disaster!  I usually don't go to this Del Taco because of the lack of customer service [i.e.] ask for Mild sauce in the drive thru and get a handfull of Scorcher, ask for soft taco and get a hard taco.  I was driving by last week and decided to give them yet another chance; big mistake.  I ordered my usual #7 with Iced Tea.  When I got back to my office, I took a swig of the Tea and thought I'd just drank floor cleaner.   I tried to call the restaurant and the 800 number but they never answered.  This left me no choice but to file a complaint with the County Health Dept.  I couldn't get the SOS taste out of my mouth for the remainder of the day.  

Steer clear of this Del Taco!
