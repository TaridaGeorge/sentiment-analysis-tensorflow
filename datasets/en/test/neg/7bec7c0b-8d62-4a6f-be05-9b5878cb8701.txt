Ugh! I was so excited to try this place. I love Pane Bianco- the quality here was not at all comparable. Let's start with the service-some of the worst I've had in Phoenix. It was empty and there were about six people standing around goofing off while we just sat there. The menus were completely wrong and after the staff had made "my order" which was pretty much whatever they felt like they asked me if it was ok. Service wise it got progressively worse from there. The food...let's start with the bread, it was so encrusted with cornmeal that it was extremely gritty as well as being overly salty. My pasta was bland and the sauce wasn't really a sauce at all but just butter with a few fried sage leaves. NEVER going back.
