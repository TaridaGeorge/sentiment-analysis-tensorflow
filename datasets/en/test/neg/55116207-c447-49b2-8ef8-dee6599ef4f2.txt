This place should just shut down.  Went for drinks before the TOOL concert and they had 4 people working...REALLY?  Waiting for 10 minutes at the bar, gave up and went inside, waited for another 15, nothing...They didn't even have tub girls set up....Bad planning.  We went down the street to cooperstown and although they were slammed, they had servers and we were able to get beverages before the show,  I would never go back to jackson's again.
