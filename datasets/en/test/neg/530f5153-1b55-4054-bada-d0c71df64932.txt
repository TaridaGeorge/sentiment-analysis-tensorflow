I like the new look but hate the confusing new set up. It's all, "I'm a buffet, but nope no I'm not!" 
Ordered the 1/4 white chicken with mashed potatoes & bacon & onion Mac & cheese. Comes with complimentary bread. Chicken was good and moist. Mashed potatoes have no taste and Mac & cheese is dry without the slightest taste of cheese! Tried the cornbread which is so dry it literally leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. The focaccia bread is on the oily side and the batch we got was way overloaded with rosemary. Also got the fettuccine pomodoro which is cooked fresh to order and wasn't bad but definitely nothing I'd order again. I like the new look but definitely not the new food.
