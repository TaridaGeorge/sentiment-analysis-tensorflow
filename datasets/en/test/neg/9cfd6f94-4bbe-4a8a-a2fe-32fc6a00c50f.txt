The woman who works night at the front desk is a horrible! Every time I've been here, she's been rude, bitchy, she lies, and just makes your stay as awful as possible. She actually called the police on my friends and I. No phone call letting us know we needed to shut up, no warning, no nothing. When the cops came to talk to us, they were joking and laughing it up with us. They thought it was a waste of time also. We told them how the lady at the front didn't give us any kind of warning, and all 3 cops said "Yeah, she does that a lot."

She sucks. Nice hotel though.
