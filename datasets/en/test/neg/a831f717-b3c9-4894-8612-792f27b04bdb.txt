I was at an event where they brought in Sprinkles cupcakes. So I can't write about the experience of going into the store. But I do know a good cupcake when I taste one and the one I had was not good. It was a chocolate cake and I think a white frosting with chocolate sprinkles. The cake was very dry. So much so that it was difficult to eat because it crumbled every time I took a bite. Also the frosting left a funny aftertaste in my mouth. I know it's possible that it was just an off batch, but for my cupcake fix I'll continue to support the local Scottsdale Bakery and Cupcake Company for now.
