How this place stays in business I have no idea. Food is gross,  the place is empty all the time, small dishes, over priced. Service is totally crap. The parking lot  looks like a place one could get raped in. If you're handicapped you are screwed one parking space for the whole building. Pot holes everywhere, I can't believe they haven't been sued yet for the condition of the parking lot.
