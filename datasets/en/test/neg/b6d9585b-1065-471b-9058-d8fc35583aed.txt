Tonight my first-ever wax with European Wax Center. I called ahead to schedule an appointment & asked for a bikini wax. The operator explained that I would be asked however much or little I wanted to be removed from my front side. About 10 minutes into my wax, blocked from seeing myself of course, I felt wax being applied EVERYWHERE. After a few strips were pulled, I asked whether this was a "bikini wax" and my waxer explained this was a "full" bikini wax. No questions asked - my hair was GONE. 

Afterward, I looked at myself completely after I sat up and found whole sections of hair she had failed to remove - not just strays, but clumps of 20-30 hairs. A painful tweeze job when I got home.

What a pleasant first experience. No thanks & never again, European Wax Center.
