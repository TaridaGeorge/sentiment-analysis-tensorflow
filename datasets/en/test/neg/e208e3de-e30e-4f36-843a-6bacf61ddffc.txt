When you're on a burn through Arizona on your way to Scottsdale,  You may get a hankering for an icy treat! 
Look no further than the ho-dunk, stand-alone Dairy Queen in fabulous Gila Bend!

Cozy up to the locals, hell they don't bite.. They don't have teeth! 
And don't let their grizzly appearances fool ya; sweetest people west of the Mississippi.

No, but really..
I highly recommend getting whatever the hell you need and GTFO. 
Maybe take a picture of the interior for laughs...
