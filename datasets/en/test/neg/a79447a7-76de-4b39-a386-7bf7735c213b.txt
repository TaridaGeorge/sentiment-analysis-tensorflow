The floors are dirty, the food is overpriced, there's never enough people at the cash registers (although there's rarely a lot of people in here) and I worry I may actually need something from the adjacent CVS pharmacy when I enter this place.  Please tear down and build an....LA Fitness or maybe a Sprouts or Whole Foods.
