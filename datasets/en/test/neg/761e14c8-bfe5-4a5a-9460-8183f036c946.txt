I have never ordered a chicken gyro and received something so disgusting. The "chicken" was a flattened hunk of mystery meat. It looked like a couple slices of thick turkey lunch meat packed with fillers. 

There was no way it was going in my mouth. 

I pulled it out and then tried to eat the--now veggie--gyro. It was still awful. The tzatziki sauce was so bland it could have been water. The pita itself was nothing special. And the water from the soda fountain dispenser tasted worse than tap.
