The first time I went there and sat at the counter for 5 minutes, they just stared at me and would not come up and take my order.  The second time I went there I brought a young lady with me and we sat at a table.  While we were being served, my date became upset because the owner or manager (an older man) was making loud racial jokes and kept looking over at us.  I've never been back there again, and when I mentioned it to a friend of mine, he said he got the same treatment and will never go there again.
