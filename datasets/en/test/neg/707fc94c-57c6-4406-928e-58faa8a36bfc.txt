Don't go in the summer time!! it is way too hot here. It's unfortunate but the management here can't seem to figure out how to cool the dance floor, it's not just me as everyone dancing is complaining about the heat. Some simple fans pointing towards the dance floor would prob help but there doesn't seem to be anyone to tell except the doormen and they act as if they could care less.  If your going here just to drink and socialize you will need to go outside in the heat, it's way too loud to hear anyone inside. It was a great place last season, maybe it will be again.
