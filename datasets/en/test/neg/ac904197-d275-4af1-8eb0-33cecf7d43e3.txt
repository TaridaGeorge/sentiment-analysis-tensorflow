The salon has moved from its original location, now it's in a strip mall down a long dark corridor in a tiny, cramped room and there is barely room for the stylist, a parent, and a child.  The stylist arrived late, was rather shockingly unkempt, and sat down upon arrival and talked at us for thirty minutes before starting to cut my daughter's hair.  Not sure why I waited, but I didn't want to be rude.  Forty five minutes later, we had a haircut that did not resemble in the least the cut I'd requested and I was just happy to get out of there.  Wouldn't dream of going back and would never recommmend it to anyone.
