This goes for all PB's not just this particular location.  Shame on you! I used to love this place and it was #1.  I loved you 10x more than Wildflower.  Guess what? Wildflower surpassed you in quality now.  

You are trying to save money and thought we wouldn't notice you are giving us less and charging us more and complicated the salad menu.  But not only are you saving money by giving us less... the product itself just isn't the same.  After years of going there, I have no intention to go back.  It just isn't good anymore and I don't like being tricked.  In these times, you're getting more for your money at restaurants.  Why is Paradise Bakery doing the opposite?
