Wow this place has very bad service.   Stopped in for a personal size pizza had 45 min before movie starts next door.  Seated no more then 20 feet from the pizza station.  After 30 min the server comes by and says they are still woking on it.  15 min latter we walked out with nothing.  This was the  only time we talked to the server and the Manager never came over, even though he could see us seating there bored to death, to explain why they are inept.  
Had more conversation with the bus boy as he pickup around us.  Really how long does it take to bake  a 12" pizza 5 -8 min.
Never again, has been 3 years since I was there before and it was so-so then, so it's not gotten better.  Fool me once good for you, fool me twice shame on me.
