I gave this place a second try because i figured maybe we got all the wrong stuff the first time. Also because my friends are always raving about this place. So we went back to try the deep dish and waited over 45 minutes for a table (what a waste) and after ordering and praying it was gonna be as amazing as everyone says it is, it was....

DUSGUSTING!! I barely finished one slice. This place is SO OVERRATED. I think food out of a garbage  just might taste better. All I know is if I had the option to eat at this place or the gargage, garbage would be my solid number one choice.
