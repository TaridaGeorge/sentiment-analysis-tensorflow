Just shoot me.  A Touch of Thai is just that: "a TOUCH of Thai" :)  I haven't tasted such below average Thai food before.  Go to Siam Thai not far from here, but sooo much better: http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=289

Siam Thai has more authentic taste than Thai restaurants I'm used to eating at in Phoenix.  Their Phad Kee Mao is wonderful, by the way.  They're at 5008 W. Northern Ave, Glendale, AZ 85301.  Open Tues-Sun.  Go--you won't be disappointed.  Tell me what you think after you go.
