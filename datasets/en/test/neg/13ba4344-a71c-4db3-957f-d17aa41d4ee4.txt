There is a good reason why this place doesn't post their prices: it's because if they did, most folks would walk right out. This is the first place ever that makes Starbucks seem inexpensive. They have only 2 sizes of drinks, a tiny 8 oz and one that is probably 12 oz. Originally I wanted a Mocha and that was going to be 5 bucks (before tax), so i switched to a regular coffee which costs almost 4 bucks for the 12 oz size. That was my que to laugh this place off as a joke, especially in a college town, and head over to Circle K, where there were 12 choices of coffee waiting, all for under 2 bucks. ASU college kids must have more of daddy's money because nobody was buying $5 cups of coffee back in the good ole days.  No outdoor seating either.
