My girlfriend and I go here often, and we know that the food is amazing.  We went here a week ago and had to wait for over an hour for a philly role and a seaweed salad, and this is seeing other customers who came in thirty minutes after us and had their entire order already.  We asked the server once politely after an hour of waiting, and she said she was sorry that they cooks were backed up (this was about fifty minutes waiting.)  Then came the hour waiting point and my girl freaked out and canceled the remainder of our order, paid our tab, and vowed never to go there again because of the horrible service.  What a waste because of the great sushi they have...
