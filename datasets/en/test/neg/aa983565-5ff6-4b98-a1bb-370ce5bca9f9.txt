The decor was nice, the hostess was pleasant and that was the only good thing. My husband and I went there 4 dinner but the server never came back to take the dinner order. He got our drinks asked if we like start w/ an appetizer so we did. The runner brought the food and we never saw the server again... $30 for 2 drinks and an appetizer total waste of money. I got the feeling the guy just didn't like the idea of having to serve ppl...don't waste your money
