Not a god place for low carb eaters. I asked the cook politely if I could get two cheeseburgers made without the bun and pickle, he looked at me and pointed to the bin of ready made, dried out assembled cheeseburgers. I again asked, he points to the bin and tells me it will be 15 minutes before he will be cooking more meat. I wait for the 15 minutes. When I return the cook is scrubbing the floor, he sees me waiting and then walks to the other side of the room to chat with another employee. I find a manager, explain what I want and she takes care of it. Remember when restaurants had GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?????
