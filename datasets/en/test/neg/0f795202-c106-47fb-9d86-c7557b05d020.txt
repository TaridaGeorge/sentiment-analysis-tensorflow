Good tea, horrible service. 

I've been here several times with my girlfriend, and after the last time we've decided not to come back. Once you walk in the door you're never greeted by any of the people behind the counter, which every time we've been seem to be teenage girls more interested in their own conversations than the paying customers. Eventually we were asked if we would like something, and after we received out tea and sandwiches we never saw or heard from anyone again.

I tried several times in a loud but polite voice to get someone's attention so I could buy some tea for Christmas presents. No avail. After waiting at the counter for 10 minutes while the girls chatted I was finally able to pay for our cup of tea and sandwiches and head out the door. 

Sorry, but I absolutely cannot recommend this place.
