I went to this beautiful building with Great expectations but WOW what a disappointment. I sat at the upstairs bar and ordered a beer great except a little high price. after 30 minutes I asked for a menu after the shuffle to find one and then explain the items they were out of I ordered the RNR burger and waited 52 minutes and it was cold as my beer the bartender said OK we will not charge you for it Really?
I paid cash for my 2 beers but they took a credit card to run a tab it took 4 days to clear the pending at my bank. just a bad deal
