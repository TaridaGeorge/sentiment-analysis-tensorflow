Buyer Beware!!! Do NOT buy from their bankruptcy liquidation sale - they are bringing in merchandise that R&S never carried to augment the sale. We're talking wood veneers and fillers - we were scammed on our dining room set and are out several thousand dollars (the salesperson told us it was solid wood!). You go there *thinking* you'll get a high end piece of furniture but they're using the R&S name to sell lesser quality items.

*Update* After contacting the company handling the liquidation, and even getting an e-mail from the former owner of R&S, we were refunded our full purchase price.   I'm sticking with the original rating only because people visiting the bankruptcy sale need to know they're not getting the same quality they would expect from the R&S name.
