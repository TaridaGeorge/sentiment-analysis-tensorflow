Me and my wife tried this place for the first time yesterday.... what a mistake!
I had the Pad Thai with shrimp and steak, it was horrible!!!! the steak tasted like leather, the shrimp tasted like rubber balls of bland white fish. I will not go back, my wife's meal was horrid also...

An off night? don't know, but if it tastes like this all the time, they will not be in business much longer...
Guaranteed!!
