Big thumbs down for me,

I have been here quite a few times, but this last time was the most disappointing.

I asked for a water from the bar, and they charged me 2.50 for water with a lemon and lime in it, can you believe that?  

She rang it up as a Sierra Mist, and I even tried to correct it, and she insisted that they charge for that.

With a 0 tip, I am sure the waitress will think twice about doing that next time, if there is a next time.
