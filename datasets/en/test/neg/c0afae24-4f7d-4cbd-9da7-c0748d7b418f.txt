So originally I loved taking my son to Children's Campus Too..  Up until they had to move locations to 43rd Ave and Thomas.  This area is horrible and the office is disgusting and very UNCLEAN!!!  After moving to this location, I noticed that the children were always sick and the staff wouldn't stick to the sick policy.  My son was enrolled in a total of three and half months.  He was ill six different times two in which required overnight hospitalization.  He ranged from getting a cold that required antibiotics to pink eye to coming down with an infection that included at 104 degree fever.  Unfortunately, this place on Camelback and 32nd Street I would highly recommend, but since closing the doors there, and moving all of the kids to Children's Campus on Thomas, I wouldn't recommend you take your child there.
