They will sell you rancid food!  I don't know what is with this place but the food tends to make me sick and I have heard the same from others about locations everywhere.  Are the using spoiled meat or something.  The only good thing I can tell you is they have sirracha sauce in little packets.  I did have some Walnut Shrimp that didn't make me sick, but I am now scared to try it again.......!
