This Subway is the absolute worst! The staff of this place is so strange. They have the weirdest people working at this location. They are so creepy that I will never go back, This Subway is close to my house and I go out of my way several miles to go to another location. They all seem annoyed when you come into the store, half of them are usually in front of the store smoking. When they make your food, they sloppily throw it together, this place sucks! Do yourself a favor, go to another location. I have tried to contact the owners to tell them how uncomfortable the staff makes people feel but can't seem to find a phone number.
