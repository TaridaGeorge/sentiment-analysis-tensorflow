Meh, for sure. Since we were staying at the hotel we thought we'd pop over for a drink and light app. What a weird space! Here we are, in the middle of a desert with gorgeous views, land, and sky to see, and this dungeon is what we have available to us.

Service was fine. The bartendress was nice. The food selection sucked, and our cheese platter was sub-par. What a waste of space.
