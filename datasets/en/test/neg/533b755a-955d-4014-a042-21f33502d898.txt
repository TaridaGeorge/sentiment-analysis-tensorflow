The first time I as here was years ago and only for a couple of drinks after a show at ASU Gammage.  As I remember it was not very busy even then.  Last Friday we ventured into Boston's after plans we had didn't work out, as it turns out we should have just gone home.  On a Friday night at 7:00pm this place was empty, I thought we got lucky, not so much.  We ordered an appetizer which was tiny and expensive and not very good.  I won't really go into what we got for dinner, because really what's the point?  The food was barely edible.  The service was seriously lacking as well, it seemed like our waitress was even lest interested in being there than we were.  We will not return.
