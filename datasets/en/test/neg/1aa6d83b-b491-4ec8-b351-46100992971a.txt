Crappy wash....happened to be the last car of the day and they were in such a hurry they didn't even wipe off the console. New ding in my door that I got a shrug and a "not our problem" excuse for. Like an idiot I dropped my cell phone somewhere from the bench to my car and even thought it was only employees left....somehow no one found the phone. Give me a break..my problem to be sure...but I appreciate integrity in the people I deal with and this is clearly not the place to get it.
