A shopping cart was missing after going through the carwash.  The Manager said it was impossible because of surveillance equipment-- Could I prove the cart was in the car?  It was in the car on the last stop before the wash but I didn't have a picture of the car interior as it entered the system. I filled a complaint with the Better Business Bureau but they have been unable to get a response for my request to replace the cart.  If you must go there take a picture of your car interior on your phone so you can  pinpoint the location & time of picture to prove what was in your car.
