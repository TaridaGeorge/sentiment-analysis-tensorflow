I hate to do this to a mom and pop type of business but I have to say... don't eat here! I got the Salmon Teriyaki Plate for $9.29 including tax and it is just a sad, sad dish. There is a very small piece of salmon which is overally salty, a scoop of rice which is undercooked and tastes old, and a salad of lettuce with a little carrot on top. 

Maybe the sushi is better although I have my doubts.

btw, still hungry!!!!!
