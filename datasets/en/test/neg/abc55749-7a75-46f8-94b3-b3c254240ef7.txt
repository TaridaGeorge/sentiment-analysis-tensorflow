Decided to stop in because of the signs around the area. The front staff is not friendly at all. I'm not even sure why they are checking people out. Very cold. Also not impressed with my cupcake. The price for a standard size cupcake with store bought frosting that was slightly over cooked, was a rip off!!! I could have made my own cupcakes, saved money and not have to have dealt with bad attitudes!!!  Not worth it at all!
