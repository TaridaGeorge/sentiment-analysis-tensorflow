One star because zero isn't an option. I hate picking people up OR dropping them off here but far worse is having to FLY to or from here. Wheelchair service is a joke... It already is awful to need thus service they should make it easier and not make you feel like garbage for needing it. 

Then there's the restrooms. Both on the way out and on return they were worse than most gas stations I've visited. Gross. I would rather drive. At least as far as a better airport.
