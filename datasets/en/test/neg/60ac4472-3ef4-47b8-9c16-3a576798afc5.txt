Had gone to firestone in Tucson while in college, figured I could trust the company/brand in Scottsdale. 1year old civic, 15k miles...went in for oil change and was given a $600 list of recommended services.I declined (thank g.) & and took it to Honda for my next oil change (4k miles later) everything was fine. Firestone lost my business. Sucks most bc zipps is right next door. Boo!!!!
