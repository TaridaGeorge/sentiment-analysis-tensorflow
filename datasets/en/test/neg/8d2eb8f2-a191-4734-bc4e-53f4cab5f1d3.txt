Bland, blech, barf. 

That's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) 

I think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice. 

No spice. No life. No business from me.
