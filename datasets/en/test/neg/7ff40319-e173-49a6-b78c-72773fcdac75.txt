I agree with Pauly C. I disagree with his review being GTL. I am also from Texas, the meat beneath the breading in the chicken fried steak was absolutely atrocious, the gravy was decent but not the best I have had. The bread was deplorable, I've had better day old bread from fry's. The bbq sauce tasted worse than krafts original, and this is supposed to be a homeage to Texas BBQ and food. I would never go there again even if I was starving and paid to eat there. For real bbq visit Bobby Qs on 27th ave and northern, I have yet to find a decent chicken fried steak in Phoenix.
