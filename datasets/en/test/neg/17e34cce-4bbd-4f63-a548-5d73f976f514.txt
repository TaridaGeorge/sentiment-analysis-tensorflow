this place is just AWEFUL!!  If you find yourself walking by and are tempted...JUST KEEP WALKING...IT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE.  
The manager could care less...and was busy flirting with the cute girls.  
The bartender was clueless, dare I say....stupid.....slow, unorganized.
Our food arrive 45 minutes after we ordered..AND WE WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES!
I hope they re-open SAM's Cafe in its place in a few months...I am sure Stingray will not be there long!!!
