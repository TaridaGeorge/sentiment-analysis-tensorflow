New ownership has most certainly ruined the food. The atmosphere had changed from a nice private restaurant that served exceptional new mexican cuisine to a cheap unorganized cantina. I promise you the service is not acceptable. I know that the bartender, Jamie, that works there spit in my drink. Beware.
