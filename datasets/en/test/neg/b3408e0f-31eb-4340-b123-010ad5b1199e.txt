CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED...  Right around the christmas holiday, We noticed the place was suddenly closed up, (a nice Christmas surprise for the employees I'm sure).  And there were U-Hauls out front taking things out of there.
I was told by a couple of frequent patrons, and some of the other building's tennants, that it was seized by the IRS, and the owner went bankrupt there after.   
?? I don't think it was even open for a full year!
