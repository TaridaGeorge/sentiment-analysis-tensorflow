By far the worst pedicure my sister and I have ever gotten. I think there was more paint on my toes than on my toenails. And my sister was cut twice on her cuticles. I would give zero stars if I could. We are trying to find a good nail salon in this area, but this is not it. Save your money and go somewhere else.
