Beware being ripped off at Au Petit Four!  If only i can give no star, i would.  We dined late on a Saturday night. We were the only table in the restaurant.  The desserts were good, but very expensive- (1) coffee $2.00, (2) Arrowhead water $2.00, (1) Lorina lemonade $3.50, (1) mango mousse cake, (2) Creme brûlées, (1) chocolate chip cookie, (1) white cake, all total to $48.50.  It was an indication when there were no price tags for the desserts.  The owner didn't even give us an actual bill, but just came by to tell us the total.  We were all pretty tired and didn't give too much thought of the amounts. I am extremely disappointed, SHAME ON YOU AU PETIT FOUR!
