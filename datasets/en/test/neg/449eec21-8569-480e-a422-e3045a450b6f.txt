So we went in here expecting great mexican food. We saw this restaurant all over ads in travel magazines. Everything looked great in the pictures well those are lies.  There werent many dishs to chose from. There "hand made" (not really they used a machine to flatten them) tortillas werent even that good they over sauced there enchiladas. i ordered salmon the salmon was very good put they put way to much soy on the wild rice... i couldn't even tell it was rice. Don't waste your time here. 
P.S: The restaurant doesn't even look like the pictures not a good atmosphere
