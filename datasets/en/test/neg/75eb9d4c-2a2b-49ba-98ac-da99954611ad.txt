do they think we poped up in LA or NY? the entire security staff at this hotel has the worst attitude. this is not the best place to go, unless your there on a goshtly dead night, they can't handle the pressure of more than 1 party at a time. can you say MEATHEAD stay away from the JUICE? if you can, your in.....my suggestion is the sushi aroku, as they are owned by different owners and customer service still means something to them. its in the lobby, but don't expect to take your night cap out to the bar if you bought it at the sushi restaruant, different liquor license means "YOU NO GO OUTSIDE" restaruant with your drinks, stay put baby...and drink up.
