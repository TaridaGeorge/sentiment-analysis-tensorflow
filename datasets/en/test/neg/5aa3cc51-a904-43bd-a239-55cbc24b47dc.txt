Another $1500 deposit! Really! I hate all of you! Might I add that I DO pay my bills in full every month and have never been late! .......but yet I am still considered "high-risk"! Did I mention I have perfect credit!?! Someone needs to take this monopoly down. If there are any other power companies out there please let me know I will switch my service in a heart beat.
