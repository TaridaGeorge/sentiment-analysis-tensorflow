I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  "It's good, I fixed it good".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  "I fixed it good".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place.
