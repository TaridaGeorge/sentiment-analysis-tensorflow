I keep telling myself I'll never shop here again, then I try to give it another shot. Today was the last time. Hot deli staff are unusually hostile, today was no exception. I asked if the pizza that was being cut was going to put out for individual slice sale or if it was a take-out order for a customer, the reply I got was "I'm trying!" in a snotty tone. 

I'm not sure if they are used to being treated poorly by Snottsdale Grayhawk types however that's not MY problem. In addition to the employees being rude, they quality and quantity of selections has decreased markedly over the past 5 years.

My experience pertains to the deli only. The rest of the store is an average grocery of average quality.
