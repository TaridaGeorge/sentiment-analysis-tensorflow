The food is good and I have always loved going here for lunch or dinner...until the roaches crawling on the walls, the tables - EEEWW!  Click on the date for any "complain inspection" and you will see they find roaches here - continually!  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=129281&business=SWADDEE%20THAI%20CUISINE&address=5055%20%20%20W%20%20RAY%20RD&permitid=SG48994  I have stopped going here and, instead, go to Yupha's Thai which is better food and, no roaches.  Note that the Via Linda location does not have any problems and, in fact gets awarded Silver or Gold awards from the Maricopa County Inspections.  It is only the Chandler location that is a problem and should be avoided.
