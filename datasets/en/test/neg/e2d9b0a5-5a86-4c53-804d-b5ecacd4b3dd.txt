Compared to the other Walmarts in the area, this place should be torn down to the ground.  It looks old and outdated.  This isn't a Super Walmart.  It's dirty and filthy.  Stained walls and floors, the racks look like they haven't been cleaned in years.  Ugh!

I don't understand why people still go here.  I guess it's close but the products on the shelves are nothing compared to other Walmarts.  I only go here is I need shampoo or kitty litter.
