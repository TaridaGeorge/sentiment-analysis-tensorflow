I have been here one time, got a pair of shoes, my first ever Nike brand shoes. Their selection in wide shoes is very limited, but I was able to find one pair and I took them home. Service in the store was otherwise very good. The  place is very clean.

Now, they are spamming my mail box with shoe fliers. What's worse is they contacted my bank and got my address without my permission, which is creepy stalking behavior. Very creepy.

So if you go here and pay on plastic, be prepared to be stalked.
