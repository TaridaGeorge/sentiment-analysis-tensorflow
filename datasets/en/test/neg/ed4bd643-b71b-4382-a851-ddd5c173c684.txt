NEVER EVER EAT HERE!  YOU MIGHT DIE!!!!!!!
It is so disgusting.  The food tastes like grease and the omlette was scary.  A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!

It reaks of smoke and is just plain nasty.  The only good think about it is the sign.  If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.  

And I like diners.  My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities.
