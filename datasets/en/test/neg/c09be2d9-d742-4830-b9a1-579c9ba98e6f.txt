I wanted to buy the groupon for this place, so I read the reviews (despite seeing the 2 stars on yelp). Clearly, I am not goin to either buy the groupon now or ever plan to go this place. It seems the management neither cares about the reviews here nor does anything to change that. Plus it pains me to see the correlation between the prices of the items here, the quality of food/ambiance offered & the ratings on yelp. I am sorry I am reviewing this place before actually going here, but thank you yelp for the warning. Not changing this until I see an improvement though
