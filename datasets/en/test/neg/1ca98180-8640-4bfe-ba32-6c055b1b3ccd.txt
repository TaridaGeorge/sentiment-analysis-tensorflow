The high point of our meal was the cold mug that our beer came in. Worst food, worst service, and just plain ick. Not that clean here either. The service was slow and inefficient with messed up orders and confusion. The food was tasteless though hot. With so many choices out there, take my advice and skip this place. Your stomach will thank you later when you are not suffering like I did. One star for the ice cold beer.
