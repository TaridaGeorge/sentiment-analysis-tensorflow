Drove in from North Chandler to Dickinson Gateway to enjoy their IMAX.   Got to cashier to be told  IMAX is closed for technical issues.  In other words they do not have redundant projectors. I asked to talk to the manager and it seems they are too busy to talk to their customers.  I called on my cell phone and talked to a female manager or so she said.  Basically its too bad and if you don't like it go somewhere else.  Bad experience.
