Horrible experience - very disappointing! I tried this place last Saturday for the first time and won't be going back for more.

The lady (I think she was Russian) who gave me a pedicure was rude (told me that my choice of polish color) won't look good. She was also rough and smeared my toe (on my sandal). I had to call her attention to fix the smear - she appeared pretty lazy.

So, I did not tip that day - I always tip for good/great service but not that day. Plus, I thought they were overpriced.
