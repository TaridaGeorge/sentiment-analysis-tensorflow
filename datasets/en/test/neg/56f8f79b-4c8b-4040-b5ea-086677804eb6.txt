The customer service at this store is horrid.  Too bad Yelp doesn't let you give a 0 or negative number.  The "Performance 100% Satisfaction Guarantee" means nothing at this place.  They won't even let me return the lightly used product that is falling apart, rather they sent it back to the manufacturer and are waiting for them to "do something about it".  Crazy.  I even have a receipt!  Apparently it's up to the manager.  What kind of a guarantee is that!?

I'd never buy something from this store, I might buy little things from another Performance shop or online.  Never, ever this store.
