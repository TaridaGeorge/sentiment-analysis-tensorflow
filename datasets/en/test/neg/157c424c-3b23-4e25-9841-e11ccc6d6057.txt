Our first visit was a five:
We came across this place by accident but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. My husband had the silver city sub which is an Italian style sub, which he said was one of the best he has ever had. I had there home stake which was really good as well.

Our last visit would be !/2 a star:
Service was very slow and the sandwiches were not very good at all we should have gone to Jimmy Johns down the street. We wont be going back!
