Wow how things must have changed.  I couldn't disagree with these reviews more.  First off, you walk in and it not only looks old and dated, it is extremely dark and feels dirty.  I'm not saying it is dirty, but it feels like one of those chineses resturants that seems like the last time they did anything to it, was when it was built.  There are stains all over the cielings. There is no privacy in the various chairs and everyone can see and hear what is going on during your procedure; I was very uncomfortable. This is the only dentists I ever went to that didn't give me a toothbrush!  As far as administartively, they are lacking in that area too.
