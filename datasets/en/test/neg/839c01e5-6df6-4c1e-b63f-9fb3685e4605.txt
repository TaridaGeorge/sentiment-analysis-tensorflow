I went there with my parents who were visiting from out of state, and I tried several of the yogurt flavors, and was disgusted, and chose some of the ice cream from the front canisters which didn't look very fresh either.  My Dad on the other hand didn't try the flavors first before buying, choosing a few flavors for himself to try, ended up eating it even though he didn't like it and was sick for the next 2-3 days.
