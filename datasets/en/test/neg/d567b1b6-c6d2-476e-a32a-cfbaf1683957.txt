Ghetto!  You know, I realize we live in Arizona and grass is hard enough to grow in our ridiculously harsh climate, and having dogs trample all over it all day makes it even harder.  That being said, I have visited many dog parks with grass.  So, can someone explain to my why this dog park is 100% gravel?  I'm not even sure it's all gravel, I think there may be some needles and broken glass mixed up in there.  The place is all sorts of hilly with nasty scratchy bushes everywhere.  Our dog, Rally, did not care for this place at all.  After sniffing the perimeter, he came back and laid down next to us.  Also not a good place for people, as there is only one bench and very, very minimal shade.
