Not a very well run establishment. Came here twice and won't be back.  The service was less than mediocre. I had left something behind on my last visit, went back for it, was told they didn't have it but I left my number just incase it came up. I got a call in the middle of the night from someone's cell later that night telling me they found it. Then I got a few butt-dials from the same person around 3 am! Not very professional.  And when I went back days later to pick it up, was told they didn't have it. No apology, no explanation- nothing. I asked for manager & told her what happened and even gave her number of the employee that had called me. Manager never even got back to me. What a joke.
