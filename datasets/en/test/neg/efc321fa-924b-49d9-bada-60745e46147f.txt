In its former life (aka Radio Milano), this restaurant was in my all-time top 5 in the Valley. A go-to neighborhood fave, Radio Milano had a pleasant environment, amazing food and best-of-all -- neighborhood night on Mondays and Tuesdays. 

I found the current Radio Cafe is a big letdown. The menu has been revised to largely comprise of sushi, yet the rest of the items don't seem to follow the Japanese theme. It's an awkward concept that I don't think will satisfy the reputation that Radio Milano had.

Don't think I'll be back or recommend it to my friends.
