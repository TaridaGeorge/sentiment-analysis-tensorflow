I just left after waiting 20 minutes for the bartender, Susie, to take my order.   At this rate the  game would be over by the time I ordered.   My beer was good but that is thanks to Sam Adams.    I will not go back to this tilted kilt. I would rather eat overpriced ball park food.    I wish I could have reviewed the food, but my time is more valuable than the tilted kilt realizes.
