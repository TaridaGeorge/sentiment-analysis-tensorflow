Warning: Bad sushi makes you really sick

I love sushi and good deals.  
But I will not be goin back to this place.

Went w 3 friends to check out this conveyor belt sushi
Saw same sushi go around n around n around
Picked what we thought looked fresh
All got sick that night.. 
Mentioned it at work
Turns out quite a few have tried it and gotten sick there as well

No matter how cheap 
NOT worth getting sick over
