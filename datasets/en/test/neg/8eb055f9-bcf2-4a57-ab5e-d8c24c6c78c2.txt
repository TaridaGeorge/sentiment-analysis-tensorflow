This place is HORRIBLE!! Ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito. It didnt have any chorizo in it at all! It was dry and made of corn beef hash. Which they are trying to pass off as chorizo I guess. When I asked if they had maybe got my order wrong the waitress simply said No you got the chorizo burrito. However I am SURE that is not what I got. Couldnt even eat it and they didnt even care. I spoke with the owner about it and all he said was that he would love to take me into the kitchen and "show me" the chorizo. TERRIBLE customer service and the WORST breakfast I have ever had! Its really hard to screw up breakfast! Dont waste you time!!
