Bad choice!

I order the egg rolls to start off with... we were done after the first bite, it had a bad after taste as if it was rancid.  The brisket pho wasn't any better, broth was lacking flavor and my brisket was still pink because the broth wasn't steaming hot. 

I order the chicken fried rice for my daughter... they should've called it "Fried peas and carrots with an overly cooked brown rubbery egg."  Where's the rice?! Anyway, Will not be back!
