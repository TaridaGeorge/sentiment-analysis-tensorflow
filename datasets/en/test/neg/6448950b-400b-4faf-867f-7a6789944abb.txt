It seems like I must not have gone to the restaurant all the other reviewers experienced.  We went to Oregano's in Scottsdale for an office lunch.  There were about 10 of us.  BIG mistake.

We ordered.   We talked.  We drank our sodas.  We waited.  We talked. We drank more sodas.  But mostly, we waited.... and waited... and waited.  

After an hour and a half and NO FOOD, half of our party left while the others continued to.... yep, you guessed it... wait.

Was the food good?  I didn't like it.  But then again, when it arrived at my office desk in a carry out box two hours after I ordered it, perhaps I just wasn't in the mood anymore.

One Star.  Sorry, but they earned it.
