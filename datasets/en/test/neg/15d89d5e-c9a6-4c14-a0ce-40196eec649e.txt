Our Host went and had a drink at the Bar.
Or waitress brought us half our order.
The suppose manager of the restaurant brought most of our order.
The waitress took 20 minutes to bring the check...

We should have sat at the bar. The view of the men bartenders would have counter acted the bad service.

No wonder there are a lot of vacant spaces out here!
