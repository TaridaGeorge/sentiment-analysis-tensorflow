Decor was strange, service was terrible, people who worked there were aloof, like they were not in touch with reality. I had the curry and I had to rush to the restroom 20 mins after I finished eating. You wouldn't think that would happen as a result of food from a purportedly vegan restaurant. But it did. So either there ARE animal products used in making the food, or the preparation was unsanitary. Or both. Either way, I won't be back. 

Also, all of the religious cult propaganda was a total turn off. There's even a video in repeat. It was some sort of cross between Buddhism and some other stuff some woman, the "Supreme Master" created. I just wanted a good vegan meal, nothing more, nothing less. Sorely disappointed.
