I've had their food in the past, never really stood out as great but it's the only Chinese food by my place of work. I order their Chicken Green Beans with Black bean sauce. Wasn't awful, but I've had better at other restaurants. Not only is the quality or quantity worth the price tag at all, but later that night and all throughout the next day I had food poisoning. My boyfriend had their Mongolian beef and suffered the same thing. Maybe it was a freak incident, maybe not. Either way, I won't be going here again. There's plenty of other Chinese food restaurants that deserve your appetite's attention. Hell, even Panda Express is better than this garbage.
Don't waste your time. Or your money.
