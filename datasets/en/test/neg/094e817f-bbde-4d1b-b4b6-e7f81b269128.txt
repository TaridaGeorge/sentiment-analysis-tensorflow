I used to have a Bashas next to my house which was great. They closed that location. I drove further just to find another Bashas rather than shop at Fryes. I was disappointed everytime I shopped at this Bashas. I know they were going through $$ issues but this place was horrible. I got chicken from the butcher area just to arrive home with rotten chicken that smelled really bad. The rest of the meat selection is also no good. They rarely had items in stock that I was used to buying. I now shop at Fryes.
