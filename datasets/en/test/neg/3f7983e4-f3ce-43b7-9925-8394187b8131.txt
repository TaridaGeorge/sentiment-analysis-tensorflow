My husband and I ate here once and that was too much!
We went in for dinner the prices were very high for a buffet and drink was not included.
I was disappointed at the selection , lots of fish but not a lot of other meat dishes.
My husband loves sushi and it was OK, the fish he ate was dry.I tried beef & broccoli very simple dish yet had no flavor and the meat texture was like rubber.
The service as OK the waiters seemed like they hated their job and didn't want to be there. For a place that charges almost 20 bucks a person you expect it to be great but what a let down it was.
Overall I would of saved a bunch of money and eaten elsewhere.
