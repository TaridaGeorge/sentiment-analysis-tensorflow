We went here tonight at 4 pm after seeing a movie. They sat us and there was only one other table seated. The other table had a pizza they where eating. When our server came up to us he said they just started stoking the oven and there would not be pizza available for an hour!! Really??  All you have on your menu is salad and pizza!  If you need to stoke the oven close the place for an hour to get ready for dinner service. Most places start happy hour at 3 or 4 so Grimaldi's should be ready for the dinner crowd by 4!!! We went to Sauce instead and had an awesome experience!!
