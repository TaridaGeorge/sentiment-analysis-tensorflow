Extremely disappointed in this restaurant. Solely came here based on the reviews which all fell short. The hangover sandwich did not have a full egg on it and when I requested avocado I was only giventwo slices on one side. I ended up just eating a avocado and bacon sandwich due to the lack of ingredients. As for my "double mimosa" it came in the smallest glass with the weakest contents of champaign. Yet another let down was the horrible service by our waitress. She failed to bring out water or check on us consistently but paid little attention or our requests. I have had better customer service in McDonalds drive thru to say the least. This place will not be getting my service again.
