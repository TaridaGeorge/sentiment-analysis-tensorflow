This was just OK. The service was decent, but my hot and sour soup was cold. Our Moo Shu Chicken was not that flavorful and just OK. I've had better steamed dumplings from Trader Joe's. Desert Jade in Central Phoenix is much better and less expensive. I felt this was very expensive for what you got. The inside was pretty and the service was nice, but I've had better food elsewhere. Just bleh, IMHO.
