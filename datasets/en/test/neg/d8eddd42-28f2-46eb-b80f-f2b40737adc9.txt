I begrudgingly came back to Tranzylvania after successfully staying away for over a year. A friend wanted to check it out so I obliged. The thing that puts a huge damper is the ratio of security to patrons. It seems like for every5 patrons there is a security guard. I felt like an absolute criminal as they shined flashlights everywhere, scoping out the place waiting for some big fight where they can flex their muscles. 
The alcohol selection is very limited and this place was pretty dead all night. While I found the music better than my previous trip here I have to yank 2 stars for the serious lack of atmosphere and feeling like I was being chaperoned all night.
