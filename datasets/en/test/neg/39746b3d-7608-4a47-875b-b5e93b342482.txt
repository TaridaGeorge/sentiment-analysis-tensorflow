Very disappointed on our last visit.  Prefer the Tempe location for both customer service and food.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday, after waiting for more than an hour on the patio in the heat, we learned that the prime rib was sold out.  The waiter was great (Don) but the manager was poor when asked a service question.  Will not visit this location in future, back to Tempe.  food was over seasoned... too salty
