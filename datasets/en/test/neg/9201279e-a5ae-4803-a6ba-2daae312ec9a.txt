This place stinks just like the service!! I have tried them again and again hoping it would get better but NO! The wait is so long as a walk-in so I started making appointments which didn't help either. Still watied 30min and walked out! 

Pedicures are poor along with the massage. If you ask for one tech for the pedi/mani they now make you use one person for pedi and another for the mani. Why you ask...to get better tips! 

105 outside and they have their doors open with NO air conditioning! Hotter than anything sweating and they think that's a nice atmosphere for their clients. Do they care about their customers NO only the cash in their pockets!

My advice - don't go here try a salon or another place! Horrible!!
