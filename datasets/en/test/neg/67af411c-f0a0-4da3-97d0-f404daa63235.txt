Ordered a bouquet for my mom for Vday and it was pitiful.  Called the shop and actually spoke to the owner.  She wouldnt do anything to help, said it's not about how much the bouquet is but what each individual flower costs (thats why there barely were any), lied about being BBB accredited and yelled at me to just file a complaint with them and hung up on me.  I did file with the BBB and if youre smart you'll check the BBB website.  She is not accredited with them and has an F rating. She also never responds to complaints even through the BBB much less if your just an individual contacting her.  My mother also said that she had the exact same issue with this florist.  Never using them again and going OUT OF MY WAY to warn everyone I can not to use them either.
