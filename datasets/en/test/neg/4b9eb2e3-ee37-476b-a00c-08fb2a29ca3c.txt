I give this place no stars. But i still had to give it one. The owners here only think about themself and not the other workers. I was a customer here and i do understand korean and the did not know i did and i over heard the lady owner talk really bad about the other workers there and also she made my friend feel uncomfortable because she kept on hugging him and touching his arm. Anyways this place need to change and the owner should stop touching customers like that so much it should be a place to eat and not like one of thoses drinking bars where the ladys keep on touching you!!!
