Loved Atomic Comics before they moved to this location, hated them not long afterward.

Everything that made them great--personable service, a wide selection of local comics, employees who weren't socially inept--flew out the window with the larger, brighter store. Oh, right, and then there was that whole "knowingly selling illegal copies of DVDs" thing.
