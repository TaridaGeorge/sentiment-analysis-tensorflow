Came in at 9am place seemed ok, pedcure price was good $20.  Picked out my nail color...as I headed to the back I started to notice that the place was FILTHY!! Walked by a waxing room that looked like someone slept in it, goldfish crackers, computer on bed, messy blankets & pillow.  Went into the restroom and found dirty dishes from food in the only sink!!  I couldn't even wash my hands!  Thoughts of my toes swelling up with infection ran thru my mind.  Needless to say I left quickly!!  Gross place!  Wish I could give it negative stars!
