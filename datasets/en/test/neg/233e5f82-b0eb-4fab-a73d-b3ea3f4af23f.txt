Don't waste your time or money.  I have heard good reviews of this place and gave it a try. The burgers are very, very, very greasy and not flavorful at all. The toppings and bun slide all over when you try to eat the burger. I love a good burger and this place is a complete waste of time. If you want the best burger in the Phoenix area go to The Chuckbox in Tempe. The Chuckbox is 10 times better than this crap place.
