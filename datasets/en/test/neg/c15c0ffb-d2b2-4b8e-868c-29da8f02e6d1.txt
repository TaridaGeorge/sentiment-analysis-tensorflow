I do not understand why Sapporo is still in business.  My only two possible theories is it's a mafia money laundering cover... or it's the tourists.  The sushi is the WORST as well as among the most expensive.  The crowd is scary.  The drinks are lame.  Sapporo had it's day.. and it was a fun scene back then (even though the food and drinks were no better then).  But I just don't see why anyone goes there today.
