Places I DON"T shop:
1. Places that make me check out my own groceries (like Fresh and Easy)
2. Places that make me pay to shop there (Costco, Sam's Club)
3. Places that make me bag my own groceries (Fresh and Easy and Winco)
Give me a break. Whatever happened to customer service???

I shopped this Fresh and Easy store once. When I found out that I had to check out my own groceries and bag them myself it became clear that they did not want my business.
