I am extremely annoyed with this location. I purchased some presents here for my wife. During checkout, they asked if my wife had a coupon account. I said yes, but not to put I under her account because I didn't want her receiving an email about what I purchased. What'd they do? They sent her an email with the full receipt!!  It completely ruined her Christmas morning "surprise" gift.
