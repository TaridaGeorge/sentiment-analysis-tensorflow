We've Always had a fair experience at this place over the last few years. Great beer, average food that gets the job done on a fun night out. The customer service has been going downhill recently. I'm sad to say that our recent visit to STBCo will be our last due to HORRIBLE customer service displayed by our server AND the on-shift manager. The manager was arrogant, aggressive, and completely disrespectful. With leadership like that, customers are subject to poor a experience. The beer is great and thankfully I can still enjoy STB brews across the street at Coach & Willie's. A+ for beer....by they Fail on customer service.
