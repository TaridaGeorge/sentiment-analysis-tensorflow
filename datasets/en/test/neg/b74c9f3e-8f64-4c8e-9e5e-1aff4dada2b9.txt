After getting an oil change here a few times, I needed brakes but had got my own parts as there was some special ones I wanted.  Called to get my car in for service and was refused as "they won't make enough money"   I was willing to pay whatever and got my own parts as I wanted better ones then were available locally.  Customer lost!
