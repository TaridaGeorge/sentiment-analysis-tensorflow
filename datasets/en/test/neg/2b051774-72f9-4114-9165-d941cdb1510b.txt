This will NEVER be a shopping destination, for me !
Unless I need to visit THE APPLE STORE, I'm staying away.

For the most part, the center is a collection of OVER PRICED restaurants and clubs.
If YOU need your ego (or other parts) stroked, by barely 21 year old female WANNA-BEE'S .... Take a VIAGRA and your wallet, with you.

The parking availability is terrible.
Plus the Valet reserved zones, have made it shopper unfriendly.
