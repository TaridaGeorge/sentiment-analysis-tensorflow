We planned on going to a Touch of Thai which was located next door. That restaurant went out of business so we ended up here. 

I ordered the chicken curry with carrots & potatoes with an eggroll. My husband went with the combo fried fried rice. The chicken curry had very little sauce and the potatoes were crunchy. The eggroll lacked flavor. My husband liked his fried rice, I don't know why. The entire meal lacked flavor, I could have had a tastier meal at Panda Express.
