We were excited to try this place because it was less than 5 min from our house, but we were sorely disappointed.  

First and foremost, they forgot the avacado on our "California Pizza."

We wanted the "organic whole wheat crust" but they said they were out of this.  I'm not sure how that happens, especially since we ordered at 4:30 on a Saturday.  You would think they would have enough for a busy Saturday night.

The bacon was uncooked and fatty.    

The toppings were sparse and we were unsatified after finishing.

We had high hopes going into this thinking it would be a similar to CPK, but it is unlikely we will go back.
