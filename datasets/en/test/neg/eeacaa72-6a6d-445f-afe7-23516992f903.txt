Ordered the Chicken Piccata which is supposed to come with the chicken, potatoes and fresh veggies. The veggies never made the plate. In addition, they don't have Jack Daniels - apparently corporate decided not to carry it and to go with Jim Beam. Seriously, who doesn't have jack? 

The food is poor quality. It reminds me of a cracker barrel.
