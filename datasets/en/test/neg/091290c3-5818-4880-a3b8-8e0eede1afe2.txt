My husband and I have eaten at several Filibertos around the valley. We love Filibertos. This is the ONLY Filibertos that we get sick at every time we eat there! Someone needs to get a health inspector to investigate this restaurant. If you eat there, eat at your own risk because you will be sick all night and feel it the next day like a hangover. To clarify, we're referring to the Filibertos in Buckeye on Miller Rd.
