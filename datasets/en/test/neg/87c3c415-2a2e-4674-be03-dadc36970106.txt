Horrible. Went in for 4 specific, extremely standard items and was only able to leave with one of them. Not to mention there were people waiting whose orders had been completely forgotten about. If the kid behind the register wasn't so worried about being witty, maybe he would've done a better job. Who knows. They should be much more prepared and stocked on a Saturday morning. Bosa it is!
