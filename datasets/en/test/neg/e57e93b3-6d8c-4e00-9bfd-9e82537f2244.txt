You're going to charge me $15 for the first checked bag, $5 for a wimpy "snack box" on a 4-hour flight during lunch time, and $2 for a soda?!? What happened to customer service?

And I know it's probably not your fault, but 5-year old brats sitting behind you and kicking the seat continuously while you try to study for your upcoming exam rivals the turbulent, claustrophobic connector flight you'll have to catch on a regional plane. In the only aisle without windows.

Need I say more? Never again...
