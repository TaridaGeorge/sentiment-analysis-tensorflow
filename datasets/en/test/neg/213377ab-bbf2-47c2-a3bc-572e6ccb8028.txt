I am saddened and HORRIFIED to know that I have dined here only to find out later that they serve foie gras!!!!! I was also informed that they used to have pâté but no longer have that on the menu. Force feeding food down a duck's throat to enlarge its liver for a "delicacy" is INHUMANE nor is it my cup of tea. I cannot return until this item is OFF the menu. TRULY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!
