Grrr, you could have pulled the right bike that I specifically asked for. I don't think I could have been more specific besides emailing you a picture with pointy arrows to the name of the bike. What did your salesmen do? Pulled the bike close to the color I mentioned. Nothing more disappointing than thinking you are driving very verrrrrry far to get the bike of your dreams. It was like having The Grinch steal Christmas. I won't be back and thats to bad, I'm currently saving my pennies for a cycling bike. Anyone need the address to Bike Barn?
