I work and live in the area and thought this would be a great place to chill and enjoy a frozen treat... now that its been open a few months I have to admit that I was WRONG.

The yogurt itself is mediocre and a bit pricey but at least the place itself is very comfortable and inviting (and always clean).  They have lost my business because the owner/manager is a very unpleasant "gentleman" who knows nothing about customer service.  He seems to delight in being mean to his young employees and then turns his bad attidude on his customers.  

Overall,
