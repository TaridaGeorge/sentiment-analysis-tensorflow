I had eaten here a couple years ago and it was decent food and service. I think the place has gone downhill. When you walk into a place that is empty I'm a Friday night, be afraid. Prime rib was way overcooked and fatty. Veggies were mushy. I was wearing nice jeans and a blouse and I felt overdressed compared to other patrons.  We won't be back.
