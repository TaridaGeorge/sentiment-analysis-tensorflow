The owner of this location is a real jerk.  I stood in line for 15 minutes and then when I finally got service at the counter- the old man finally told me that his credit card machines were down.  He then proceeded to get upset with ME because I didn't have cash on hand.  His exact words were "You don't have any cash on you?!?!"  Ummmm, nooo, it's 2012 - I figured Schlotzsky's was modern enough to accept credit/debit.  I have no problem with technical difficulties and machines being down, but you should let your customers know instead of having them waste their lunch hour in line and then snapping at them for not carrying cash.

I also asked him how I could go about getting a large drink with my combo meal and his response was " Pay for it."  Hilarious.
