My wife and I took sw flight # 2196 PHX-MKE 10/22.   We had just boarded the plane and I thought I had my phone off but I received an incoming phone call about the time they closed the door.   I answered the call very quietly and a flight attendant by the name of WENDY yelled in the phone "he has to go"  People from 3 rows in front of me turned around.   I have never wrote a review but the attendant carried the same demeaner for the 3+ hour flight.   I know I was wrong but it could have been handled better.   Free baggage fees don't make up for BAGS that are flight attandants
