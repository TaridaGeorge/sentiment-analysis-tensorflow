If I could give this place negative stars, I would.

See, I am asthmatic and last Spring (2011), I was having trouble breathing and thought I needed a breathing treatment. I went to Cigna Urgent Care and got in immediately, however, they tried to put a mask on me (I am assuming because it was flu season but they never told me why) and I freaked out. Bad. I was told I had to leave and that was that.

Come to find out, my oxygen level was 73 (it is supposed to be 95-100) and my freaking out was a side effect of not getting enough oxygen called hypoxia. I went to St Luke ER later and was admitted immediately and put into ICU for 10 days--3 of which on a respirator.

I felt their professional standards were sub par. I will never go here again.
