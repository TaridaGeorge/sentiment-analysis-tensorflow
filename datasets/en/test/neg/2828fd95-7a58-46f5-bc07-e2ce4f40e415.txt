Service was incredibly slow. It seemed like they had maybe 3 people working, and we'd often wait (what felt like) 15 minutes to get any attention, even when I was just standing there waiting to be seated (or greeted, for that matter).

The menu is fairly comprehensive. The food is decent. I wasn't amazingly impressed, but I wasn't disappointed, either. Some of the prices seem steep. The atmosphere is kind of cramped and congested, but it was comfortable. Slightly loud, but you could still hear each other talk.

But considering that I lost my dinner after I got home, I'm okay with not going back. No huge loss here.
