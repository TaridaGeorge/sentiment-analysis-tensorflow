The food is okay and cold. They forgot my Oder =( I had to wait at least 20 minutes to get served. It was mind boggling because the girl in the behind the counter didn't noticed that my food wasn't serve yet and she is the one who took my money and I paid for my food. She had a very passive look and overall I am disappointed with the service and food. 
The staff needs to revamp their customer service and communication skills. That's why I had to give Wholly Grill one star. I would not eat there again.
