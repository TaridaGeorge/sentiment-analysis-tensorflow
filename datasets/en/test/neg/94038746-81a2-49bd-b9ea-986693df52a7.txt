Great location, good egg rolls, bad service.  We were asked how spicy on a scale of 7 and were told that 3 is mild. I got a 3 and my friend a 4.  Both dishes were so hot and spicy, we couldn't eat!  The waitress noticed and didn't offer anything until she brought our check and by then , we just wanted to leave.  Also, when waitress brought my friend her drink, the waitress commented, "it's good! I know, I tried it!" guess that explains everything.  She did seem a bit too "happy".  Will not return.
