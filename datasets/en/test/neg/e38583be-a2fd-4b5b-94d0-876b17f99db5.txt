As much as I am a lover of all W's due to the trendy scene, the touch of details and the unique style to a hotel stay. I have to say that the W Scottsdale does provide all of this BUT the rudeness of the staff takes away from all the positives. I stayed there in May this past year and had a bad experience with staff- I recall saying to myself "Well never going back there again" Well, like any loyal person, I gave it a go again when they were having their Phoenix Suns Gala...I encountered the same rude staff and they even seemed to get more rude. I will always be a fan of W's but I will never return to this one.
