$5 cover.  Opening band = Andrew something.  Rock Lobster was main draw.  They did pretty good cover songs.

Nice bartender with a heavy hand is always a plus.  One shot = three gulps!

No problem securing a booth to goof off in.  Maybe next time people shouldn't stare at us as much?

Multiple rooms, back room has hip hop blasting and stripper poles with all reserved tables.

Outdoor area in the back with a bar as well.  I like multiple options.

***UPDATE***
I just checked my Amex.  Good thing I did.  First, they charged me more than I signed for.  Second, they added a second transaction for the same over-charged amount.  What kind of service is this?!  Outrageous.
