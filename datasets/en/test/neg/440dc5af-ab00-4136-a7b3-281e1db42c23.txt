While the staff are great, I'm not thrilled with Dr Ben. While initially for a 'check up' he was great but when further work had to be done, he became arrogant and refused to listen to my concerns. He was unwilling to work together to find a suitable solution to my problem - as he way was the best and only. 

For a quick check up, you might want to give him a go, but for any further dental procedures, I'd find a dentist who is willing to discuss things with you, listen to your concerns and problems and NOT put his hand up to stop you talking because he doesn't want to listen.
