BY FAR, HANDS DOWN, THE WORST CHINESE FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  I wish I were joking.  I ordered the usual, chicken with vegetables.  It was taking a long time so I peeked back behind the window.  The "cook", if you want to call him that, was just goofin off.  then he casually starts to throw everything in the pan.  It was awful.  Undercooked everything.  tough to chew.  obviously, it is a health hazard to undercook chicken.

the bathrooms were disgusting too.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP.
