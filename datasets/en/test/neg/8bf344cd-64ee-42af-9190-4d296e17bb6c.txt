Let's just say, you get what you pay for.  Thankfully we walked in and were seated and walked out after walking through the food lines to see what was being offered.  

The restaurant was dirty and the food appeared disgusting.  The hot food looked like fried sludge.  Sushi appeared as if it had been sitting there too long and just of extreme poor quality and limited offerings.

I would recommend that you go to a sit down restaurant and order quality food.  But then again, if you think that Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral is quality food, then this place might be up your beaten path.  

I've never given a terrible review to anyone, but there is always a first time.
