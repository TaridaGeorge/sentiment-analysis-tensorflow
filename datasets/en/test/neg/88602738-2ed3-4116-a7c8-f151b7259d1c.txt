My wife and I went to Applebees last night and it was not good!!  We tried the 2 for $20 promotion.  We had chicken wings for the appetizer and they were to heavy on the tobasco sauce with no real other flavor.  My wife had the cajun shrimp and pasta and I had the riblet basket.  The pasta contain pieces of uncooked pasta and could not be eaten.  The riblet basket had two tiny slabs of riblets with a very strong flavor of tenderizer.  I also received 11 french fries on my plate!  Needless to say we will not be back.
