When this place first opened, they tried their best to please the customer.  Every time I told them they missed something, they would go back over it and clean it properly.  The last time I took my car there, I was less than happy with the service I received.  Cleaning wheels thoroughly is a standard practice at any car wash or detail shop and being confrontational with a customer when confronted with the fact that the wheels were poorly cleaned does not sit well with me.  The other thing that does not sit well with me is the upselling of services I do not need.  I don't need you to replace my windshield, redo my tint, change my oil, or any maintenance service.  If I pay for a car wash, I expect just that and expect my wheels to be cleaned thoroughly!!!
