First impression: needs paint & maintenance outside. The cherry vanilla candle at the front desk stunk and air inside was not circulated.  No elevator. Smoking rooms not segregated so smoke drifted in. Chair was stained, carpet didnt look clean. Fridge was unplugged and mildewed.

I booked 2 but only stayed 1 night. Pushpa Patel kindly confirmed via email a refund for second night, backed up by Amex dispute service if necessary. Book using Amex only if you want to be sure of getting a refund

Would not stay again until this place is remodeled.
