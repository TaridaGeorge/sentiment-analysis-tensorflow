Microwaved Meals!

So i ended up at this terminal during a morning flight and was starving. Found the burgerking and was ready to have a biscuit, egg, sausage muffin with hash and orange juice. This BK was strange in that you picked up your selected sandwich through a window-ish thing on the counter. 

This particular visit revealed:

1) No Biscuits!! Everything is in a croissant... sadface
2) Nothing was hot and ready
3) Burger King employee was putting things in the microwave, heating them up, and then sliding the sandwiches through the window. Gross.
4) Hash browns were a greasy, NOT CRISPY, mess!
5) Orange juice couldnt be messed up (it came out a tropicana mini box)
5) Service - Terrible! 

And how much did I spend to have this experience $8!... Yes, I got ripped a new one at the airport yet again!
