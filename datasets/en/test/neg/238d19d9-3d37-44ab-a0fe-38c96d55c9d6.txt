I can't review their coffee because the rude salesgirl wouldn't let us buy any. We came here around 7pm on a Friday. The door says they are open until 10. The yelp profile says the same. She was on the phone with a friend gossiping when we came in. We stand there for at least 5mins before she noticed and said "oh yeah, we're closed." wtf?
