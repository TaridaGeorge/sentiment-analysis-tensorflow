HORRIBLE!!!!!!  DO NOT BUY FROM JENNIFER CONVERTIBLES!!!!

It would take me quite some time to write the entire story, but suffice to say, I am still battling with Jennifer Convertibles to fix the sofa bed they sent me. 

 

It was delivered on July 5th and today is September 28th. 

The sofa bed was broken, the cushions are mis-shapen and it looks nothing like the sofa from the showroom floor. This has been the most awful purchase I have EVER made!!! I will NEVER go back to them. The customer service is horrible! They do not pick up their phones, I cannot get in touch with a CEO or President of the company, and their customer service complaint person has still not returned my call. 

To say I am disappointed is an understatement!!! I'm not certain what I am going to do next, but contacting my attorney is a thought.
