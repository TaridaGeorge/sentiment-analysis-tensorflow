DISGUSTING-the cucumber in the roll was thick along with the spicy tune being slathered on the top of the roll was too thick-Just DISGUSTING. Also order the chicken friend rice-the carrots were crunchy not cooked-Just DISGUSTING-We order honey glazed chicken which was actually good but the fact that they ADD gratuity doesn't make sense when it was just my partner and I-Will NEVER go here againg and I suggest you dont either its DISGUSTING!!!
