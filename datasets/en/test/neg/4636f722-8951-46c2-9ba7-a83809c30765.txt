Review is for customer service, not car wash itself (can you really mess it up?).

If you like wheeling and dealing like in a 3rd world country street market for your car wash services, then this is the place for you.  I disliked the "what do you want, what would you like, we'll cut you a deal" statements and their back and forth,etc.  The site mgr Chris definitely had that shark like attitude, he should work for a 1980s car dealership.  Extremely bad taste in my mouth.
