We ordered a pizza and wings for pickup to tonight and were told it would be a half hour. My husband drove up to pick it up and they hadn't even started the order. They then told him it would take another half hour to make our order he left and we ordered elsewhere. This was our first time trying them out and I can't say I have any interest in going back.
