Back in the 90's I remembered Garcia's being a pretty decent Mexican restaurant. I don't know what happened, but this is Calimex, not Mexican. First we ordered enchiladas. We asked if they had red chile. The waitress said, "What?" I was like,.. nevermind, you don't. She then said, "You mean like a jalapeno?" - "No, red chile sauce, like you pour on enchiladas". She then said something like, "No, we have a tomato like sauce, but not jalapeno sauce". It was clear she had NO idea what chile was. So we get our plate, it had some sort of brown sauce, and the meat was tasteless. Really gross. They brought "salsa" and chips (kinda late, after we started our meal), and the salsa tasted like marinara sauce. Again, gross. Overall, the food was disgusting. We won't be going back.
