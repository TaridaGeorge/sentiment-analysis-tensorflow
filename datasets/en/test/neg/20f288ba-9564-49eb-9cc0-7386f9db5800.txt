I am officially boycotting this joint.  I have been shopping here for over 15 years. It was a really cool re-sale store where you good find some nice pieces for a decent price. They now have thrift store quality clothes at retail prices. My last few times in there I spent an hour or so shopping and left empty handed, waste of time, the only decent things I found were way over priced. They need to hire buyers with a better fashion sense, and that don't all look and dress the same.
