DO NOT buy furniture from here!! Yes there stuff is reasonably priced, but you will never receive it if you opt for delivery. I purchased my furniture a month ago and still have not received it. Not only did they call me to tell me it will be delayed and rescheduled delivery, but they called me a SECOND time to tell me its further delayed and had to reschedule delivery AGAIN. And to top it off, they told me I basically have to just deal with it and there is nothing that they can do for me.  Spend the extra money and purchase your furniture from somewhere else!
