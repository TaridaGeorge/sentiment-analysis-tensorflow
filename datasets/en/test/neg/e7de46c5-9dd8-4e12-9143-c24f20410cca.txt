Thanks for the heads up trigger...

A friend of mine on February 28th, 2008  who's a local African-American businessman, owner of a high-end marketing firm working with reputable clients in television, product, fashion and more, was shown racist behavior at this club.

He was with four of his Caucasian business partners they were let in, but he wasn't. When staff were asked why he wasn't allowed in the doorman replied, "I can't let you in with baggy clothes and chains and (expletive deleted)."  That's funny cause he was wearing a button down shirt, sweater vest, dress shoes and no jewelry and his partners where in t-shirts and sneakers.  Sounds like racism to me.

Not cool!
