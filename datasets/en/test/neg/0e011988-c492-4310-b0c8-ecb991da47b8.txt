Don't bother with upgrading past the luxury manicure. Not worth it! I went with two friends and they got the luxury and I got the deluxe. No difference! The owner tried telling me that I got a longer massage which is a lie because we all were done together. They also rush a lot more when they have customers waiting. I get different service every time. The gal who did my mani/pedi was very nice.
