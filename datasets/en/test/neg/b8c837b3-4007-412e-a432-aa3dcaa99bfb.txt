I fail to see a reason for this store to even exist.

Item selection in this store is sporadic, poor, the quality can not be attested to and the prices are completely arbitrary.

The store it self has a dirty and temporary feel to it. The crowd that this store attacks is also less than savory.

The store seems out of place in this neighborhood and has little use to me. Other than looking for Halloween costume crap I would not recommend stopping in here.
