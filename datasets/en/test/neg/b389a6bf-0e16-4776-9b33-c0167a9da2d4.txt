umm...lets see.  my son ordered a chicken dish. the cook forgot to take the plastic off the portioned chicken before cooking it.  needless to say......fail.
i ordered red curry beef (thai hot). was VERY mild and i wasn't sure if it was a bone or a fingernail i found in my food.  pretty sure it was a bone but one never knows.
my wife ordered some tofu dish....i think she liked it but i am not for sure.  i was still puzzled by the plastic wrapped chicken and fingernail-like bone thing.
i gave it a star because they had some live turtles to look at....i am just glad the turtles were in a pond like place and not an aquarium because the aquariums obviously hadn't been cleaned in ages.  i give their fish less than a week to live.
never going back.
