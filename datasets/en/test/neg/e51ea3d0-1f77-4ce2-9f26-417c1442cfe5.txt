pretty terrible pizza joint.  I like TJ's much more.  I've tried this place twice, and both times, it was pretty bad.  The first time, I just ordered two slices.  They took two pretty old cheese pieces of pizza out of their warming rack, threw on pepperoni and mushroom on top if it, and just served it.  I think the pizza had been in the warming rack for several hours.  The second time I tried them, I just ordered a small pizza so I knew it would be fresh.  It was, very bleah, even for pizza.  Don't  waste your money.
