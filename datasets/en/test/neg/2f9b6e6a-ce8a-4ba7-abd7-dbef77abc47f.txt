After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.

* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.

* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.

* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.

Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!
