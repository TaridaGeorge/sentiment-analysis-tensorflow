Actually run by Aramark, this Starbucks is part of the Taylor Place shops of the downtown campur of ASU. Staffed by students, service is typically friendly, if a bit slow. 

The real problem is they must be even more lackadaisical about cleaning the place. The coffee fixins station is always covered in crumbs and spills, the refrigerated foods cooler is scantily-stocked, and what's left is withered up and stale, and the bathroom is just downright nasty.

I shudder to think of the condition of the food and drink prep area.
