Really nice ambience, super nice. So nice that we wanted to stay and have a drink and something to nibble on in the downstairs bar. Unfortunately the server wasn't anywhere as nice as the ambience, she essentially kicked us out because we sat at table that was reserved (although there was no reserved sign) and didn't offer to help us find a seat in a full bar. So much for hospitality. They probably do have great offerings here in the food and drink category, but lots of other (nicer) places do too. So that's where we ended up going.
