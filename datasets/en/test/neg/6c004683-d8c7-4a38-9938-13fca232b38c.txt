I had to wait 55 minutes to see the Dr. People at the front desk were not polite and their billing department is just horrible. I have a PPO and Dr Linder's billing department sent a claim to my insurance co using the wrong group number so the claim got rejected and I got billed for the full balance. I had to call the Dr's office a couple of times and asked them to re-send the claim. For a 2nd time they made another mistake when they billed the insurance co. I got a 2nd bill. Dr Linder this is a lot of work for me. A waste of time.
