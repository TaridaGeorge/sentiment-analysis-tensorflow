Ordered Chicken Fried Steak for my free birthday meal. That probably shows my foodie ignorance, as who knows what meat is tucked in that fried, breaded coating with gravy. The whole plate was worse than I remember chow hall food when I was in the military. I sent the iced tea (probably another poor choice) back.

"How was everything?" the cashier asked when I left. 

"Free," I said.

"Oh good, glad you enjoyed it." 

I let it go.
