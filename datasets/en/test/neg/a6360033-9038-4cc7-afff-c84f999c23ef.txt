People here are one of the following: toothless, heavy smokers outside of their room on the balcony talking loud, people who likely live in a motorhome or trailer and are living the high-life here, or about 40 aging men softball players.  Then, there is me -- a cratchedly grumbly snooty hotel-stayer.

What it is: cheap; value-priced; great location next to the Fashion Square mall near Old Town Scottsdale; good for travelers; partiers, large groups needing a low-cost option.

What it is NOT: vacation spot, relaxing, nice, clean, quiet.

I didn't think I am a snob, but I undoubtedly officially have self-elected myself.  The rooms need a desperate remodel.  Never will I stay here again, unless of course, I lose some teeth, join a softball team, etc!
