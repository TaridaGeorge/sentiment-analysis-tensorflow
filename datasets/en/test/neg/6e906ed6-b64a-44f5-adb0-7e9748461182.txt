Awful front desk staff, actually we were dealing with the front desk manager.  She was totally incompetant and not willing to help, very arrogant and stuck up. 

We asked for a room upgrade and got a cold shoulder, I guess they don't like giving room upgrades in this hotel.  As Sammy S said in his review they kicked him out!!!!  

I don't think I'll be going back to this hotel considering all the other choices I have.
