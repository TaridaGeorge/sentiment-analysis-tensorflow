We went to Fiddlesticks on Saturday evening, there were 3 of us. The price was 7 a person, but I had some entertainment book coupons, so it was 2 for 1. The course was terrible, the turf on the course, was ripped in places, & there were lots of ants, I found a few insects and bugs in the hole of the course. We had fun, but wouldn't go back to that course.
