Another over-priced over-conceptualized underwhelming Fox restaurant.  Service was by a bunch of attractive, poorly trained and confused kids.  When I asked what type of bread my sandwich would be served upon, I was told "health bread" whatever that means.  Condescending "healthy" concept.  I could have forgiven all this if the food were good, but it was all bland and ill-conceived.  What a disappointment.
