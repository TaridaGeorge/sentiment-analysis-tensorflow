I used to love this place, last year...the year before. It sucks now!!!! I've tried time and time again THIS year, to give them a chance! Their drink pricing is almost double! The cover charge was $15 per person! We should have left after hearing that, but I was like, well maybe it will be worth it. They played good dance music for about 30min and then DJ played NOTHING but techno!!! No!!!! NEVER AGAIN COMING BACK MYST.
