Ditto on the rudeness.  Perfect from William B in another review: "Girl at counter.  Real harsh and angry.  probably not the best choice for any business."  Oh my goodness....with the eye rolling and sighing!!!  She had to credit me my PREPAYMENT back (no other cleaner does that) so I could gather my garments back and take them elsewhere.
