I have traveled far and wide, visited third world countries, stayed in 5 star to no star hotels and this place still leaves a sting...I had an expensive piece of clothing stolen from my room.  Yes its a beautiful spot but I have been to other beautiful spots in the world and knowing that the employees are tempted to steal from the guests left a bad taste in my mouth.  The Housekeeping Manager sent me a robe in exchange for my French linen dress that was taken from me.  I think it comes down to hotels training their staff and making sure they know that there will be consequences for their bad actions.  Wondering if anyone out there experience similar transgression...
