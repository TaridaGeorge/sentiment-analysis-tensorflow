The coconut shrimp is tasty.  The tuna salad is really good.  However, most of the menu can be acquired at Red Lobster for about the same price and even better quality.  There is virtually nothing on the menu for a vegetarian.  I would not recommend this place to someone craving seafood, as the quality and freshness are questionable.  Go to Red Lobster instead!
