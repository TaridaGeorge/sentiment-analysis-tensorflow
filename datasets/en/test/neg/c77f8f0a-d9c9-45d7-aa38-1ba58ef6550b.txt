I received the worst service of my existence at this establishment - absolutely awful , uncaring and embarrassing. Our group of 17 arrived at 11am before the rush for a retirement party. Shortly thereafter orders were taken, and others arrived about 15 minutes later and there orders were taken. All were served except me. Even those with late orders- my order was nothing special tuna melt.  Others who ordered the same received there food completed it and still nothing for me. When approached by the manager/ jerk on duty- was told we will get to it.  How awful- it makes one not want to attend large luncheons .  Pass the word don't go to this establishment.

Thanks much,
