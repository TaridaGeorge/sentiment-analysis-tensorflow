Hopefully someone will put US Air out of its misery soon, as it has to be the worst airline (and I fly a lot - top FF level in United, Continental (both star alliance) and BA).  Traveling with family and they have a ton of seats available in coach but agent unwilling to change for a 4 year old and 7 year old...
