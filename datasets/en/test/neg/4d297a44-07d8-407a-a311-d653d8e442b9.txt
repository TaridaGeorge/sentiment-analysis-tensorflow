Sad, the photos on the web and other media are from when this place was built. Just stayed there and wow! What a crappy motel! I say crappy motel as it was like a motel, dirty carpet, mold and mildew in the bathrooms, terrible service/sarcasm from staff, erroneous fees on a incidental card, (over 300.00) for no services redered, stay away. Also, you have no opportunity to speak with management and they will continue to say they are not in.. Perhaps that is why this place is run like crap, no managment around...
