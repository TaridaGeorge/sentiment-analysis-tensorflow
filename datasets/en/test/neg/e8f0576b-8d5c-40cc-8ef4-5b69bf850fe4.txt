We had dinner on a Friday night at around 8:00. The place cleared out by 8:30 and we felt seriously rushed by the staff to finishing our dinner and drinks. Pretty early for this on a weekend night; guess they had places to go.

As far as the food is concerned, for an "Italian" restaurant, it was just mediocre; the pizza crust was dry, sauce was OK; the  chicken piccata wasn't bad but also not great. We were looking forward to an excellent meal, especially the pizza, considering this is owned by Tomaso, but were obviously disappointed. Not worth the time,  money, or calories!
 There are so many better Italian restaurants in town, so we won't be back to this one.
