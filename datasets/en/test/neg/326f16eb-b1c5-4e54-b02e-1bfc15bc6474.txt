We went here for valentine's day dinner and had the 5 course meal, i am vegan so I thought yay improvisitional seitan, tofu,faux meat etc. I was so disappointed the food was bland, I got salad,soba noodles with 3 little mushrooms and other forgettable food.All and all I can cook more complex with bold flavors than their chefs, for $55 per person for the 5 course meal it is not worth it.We won't be coming back here.
