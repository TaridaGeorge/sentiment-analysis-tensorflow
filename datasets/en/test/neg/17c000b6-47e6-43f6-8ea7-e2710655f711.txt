Where's the beef??? 

Holy cow!!!  They have got to the stingiest people ever.  Check out my photo of the Kalbi entree.  I kid you not.  I've eaten here numerous times but my last visit will have to be my final visit.  Did they change ownership?  I had my usual Seafood Tofu soup and Kalbi combo.  The kalbi portion has got to be the smallest beef entree I've ever gotten anywhere.  I felt like I got robbed eating here.  Definitely didn't get what I paid for.  Never again!!  

Also, the Kalbi wasn't marinated very well, it just wasn't very tasty.  All the side dishes were of the poorest quality.  Kim chi wasn't good.  This restaurant has dropped down to one of the worse Korean restaurant I've ever been to.
