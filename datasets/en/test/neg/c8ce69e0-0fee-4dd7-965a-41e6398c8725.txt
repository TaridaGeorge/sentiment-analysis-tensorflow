Not sure how this place has gotten any positive reviews.  Each time I've been there, the service is HORRID.  They don't even acknowledge your presence, and it's as though they are inconvenienced you are bringing them business.

Losing my order for a birthday cake, without apology, and after making me wait and wonder what was going on- helping others, etc. for a good thirty minutes- I decided never to go there again.

I'm sure there are lots of great bakeries in Phoenix, with great service and baked goods.  This is not one of them.
