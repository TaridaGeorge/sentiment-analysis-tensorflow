The food is so sucky!!!!! Good chips that's all not even the salsa was good. I was truly disappointed and hope to never go here again

The service was bad.and she only checked on us when we ordered and when the foodcame even though we needed refills in between that time.  The food was burnt and just a sad excuse for Mexican food, think of other places when craving a Mexican night out.
