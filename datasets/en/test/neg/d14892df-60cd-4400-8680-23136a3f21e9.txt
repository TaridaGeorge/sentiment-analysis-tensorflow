Really?! Is this place a joke??? I come to this locaction ONLY because it is closest to my house.  The service is BEYOND terrible.  The associates are blatantly rude.  They don't even have the courtesy to wait until you leave to make snide remarks.  I was appalled.  Currently I am waitin for my paint to be mixed by their "expert." Big surprise-she gave me the wrong color.....twice.
