I have tried this place a couple of times because it is conveniently located but I wont be going back.  The first time I went there were 4 people in line ahead of me and it took 15 minutes to get my coffee.  The second time I went I ordered a vanilla latte but they forgot to add the flavor shot.  The coffee was not good enough to make up for the bad service.
