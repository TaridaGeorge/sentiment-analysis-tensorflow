I have often driven by this place and have noticed one rarely sees cars in the parking lot.  I understand why after my first and last visit. The abrasive attitude of one of the owners is intolerable.  You had better agree with her way of thinking.  Disagree with her and one might make her happy by slitting one wrists and bleeding to death in front of her.  Whether that would be enough might be questionable.
