My final trip to Los Olivos was months ago, and it was unbelievably bad. I sat at the bar with my boyfriend. We just ordered two Diet Cokes and a quesadilla. Easy, right? 
Wrong.
The bartender was ridiculous. I had to ask for refills, plates, and napkins. At one point he left his spot behind the bar for about ten minutes and came back reeking of weed.
The quesadilla was a greasy mess of goo. Somehow lima beans made their way onto it. Whatever meat topped it was gristly and gross. 
Save yourself the hassle. Just don't bother.
