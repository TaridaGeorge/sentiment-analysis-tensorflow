Loyal customer there. They did a fantastic job every time. Until this last time! They lost my order and said they are not responsible for lost items. No credit. No sorry! NO NOTHING!!! You would think they would value a customer that regularly brings in 20 plus items a little more than that! DO NOT GO THERE! Well, I guess you could go there to drop off old clothes you want to give away. They would make a freaking awesome Goodwill drop!
