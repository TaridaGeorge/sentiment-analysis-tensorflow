This place has really gone downhill in the last few years. 

When I first moved to the area it seemed like a cool place to go to. Lately the prices for their events have really gone up, the entertainment is trying to be shocking (but lame) and it just is starting to get sticky. The crowd thinks they are artsy but it is more like a half-assed S+M club in someones back yard. 

After going here about 15 times since 2004 I do not think I will go back. 

oh and be careful about where you park. The neighborhood has gotten shady.
