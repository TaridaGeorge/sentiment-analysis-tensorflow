AWFUL, waste of good bbq money

ATE:

St. Louis Ribs = 
dry, like beef jerky, some bones had little to no meat on them.

Biscuits and Honey Butter=
dry dry dry biscuit
butter was good and had some cinnamon in it

Grilled Corn =
delicious, best part of the meal (sad)

BBQ Chicken = 
very moist, pretty good, saucy

I came here for tender, meaty, saucy ribs and was sadly disappointed.
