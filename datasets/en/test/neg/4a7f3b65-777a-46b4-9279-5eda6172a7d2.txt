Terrible service. Went to eat here Saturday night before a movie. After waiting in line for 20 minutes they said they could no longer take food orders and asked us to leave. I have never heard of a restaurant dealing with customers like this. I was excited to have an Italian fast casual restaurant in my neighborhood but I do not think I will be eating here again. Food is ok, but I would suggest not eating here when it is a busy night. Clearly the management is not up for the job.
