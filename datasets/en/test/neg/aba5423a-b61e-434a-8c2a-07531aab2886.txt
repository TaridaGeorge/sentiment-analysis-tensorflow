Disappointing :(  I was dying for frozen yogurt, wish I had checked to see if Red Mango has hit Phoenix.  Had a scoop of chocolate that was ok.  Unfortunately I also ordered the coconut, which tasted like sunscreen, and ruined my palate for the chocolate.  I think this is the first time I have ever thrown a dessert away in my life.
