Came back after two weeks because I still was sick.  The registration staff was still just as nice and helpful.    Although there was no line, I saw the doctor for approximately 90 seconds.  He said you're back; I told him what was going wrong and he told me his plan and left.    I doubt my co pay and health insurance appreciated such a pathetic effort.  


I won't be coming back, there are other places where I'll be seen and treated for a bit longer.
