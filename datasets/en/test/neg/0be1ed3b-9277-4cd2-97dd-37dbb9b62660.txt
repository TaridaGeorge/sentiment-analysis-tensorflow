i'm going to make this short and not-so-sweet.  this experience warranted my first review, ever.  

the man who was working the counter, whom i soon find out is the owner, was a rude smart-ass right off the bat.  when asked if all his burgers were beef, he smugly replied, "well, what else would they be?".  a pretty valid question when the name is, magic mushroom burgers, right?  and they do have other vegetarian options, which makes him that much more of a jackass for the reply.  

when i unwrap my "burger", it is the biggest pile of unrecognizable slop i've ever seen.  i ate most of it because i was starving, then i threw up about 30min later, no joke.  DO NOT EAT HERE.  although the beef burgers might possibly taste better, the other ingredients are crap.  but mostly, this guy does not deserve your money.
