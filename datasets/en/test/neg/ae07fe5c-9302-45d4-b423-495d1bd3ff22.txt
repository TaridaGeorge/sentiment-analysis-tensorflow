This rating is for the new store currently sharing a location with Imperial Outpost Games (which by the way is a very good wargame store) - 7/29/11

No matter what the store is like, what events they run, or who plays games there... The owner is a world class jerk.  He is curt, unfriendly, disingenuous, and all together distasteful to me.

I have never been treated so rudely by anyone connected to retail.  I guess being right across from a college lets you get away with treating customers poorly since more will come in from the school.

I visit many of the CCG stores in the valley and this is the only one I will never buy a single thing from.  If you want to experience one of the nicest guys around, go to Rookies to Legends.  "VP" (the manager) is one of the nicest guys around.
