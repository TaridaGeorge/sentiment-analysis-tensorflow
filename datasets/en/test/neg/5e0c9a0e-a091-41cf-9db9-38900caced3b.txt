I give up.  I once loved the food and service here but both have deteriorated to the point of no return.  At least my return.  Once you get past the lackluster service you get mutter paneer with peas tasting like they just came out of a can and chicken tika masala so bland I didn't ask for cartons for the leftovers.  Serving the tika masala at near room temperature didn't do it any favors.  Go find Indian Paradise in the airpark, while they don't have belly dancers they have cricket on the tv and truly terrific Indian food.
