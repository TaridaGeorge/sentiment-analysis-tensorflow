We had the rotten lobster tacos and shrimp-less ceviche.  For these prices I was surprised to find the lobster mealy.   We had to search for the few pieces of shrimp in the "shrimp" ceviche (really, there were 3 small pieces on the top, after that it was a lot of digging to find the other 2 at the bottom).

Service was slow, napkins and utensils were hard to come by (reserved for regulars?), forget refills on your beverage.

I did contact management - who responded with thinly veiled insults.
