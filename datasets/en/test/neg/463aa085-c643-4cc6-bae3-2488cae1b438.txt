....Speechless.....I mean really...I don't understand how anyone could call THAT sushi.  I usually don't flat out say horrible...but this place, it is horrible.  I understand that there are people who have not been exposed to anything but this so called sushi place.  If you are one, please please do not think this is it.  If you want good sushi in Arizona, try Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  Yes, it is more expensive but at least you are eating SUSHI.  

*Decor = trying very hard to be "hip"
*Atmosphere = loud with drunk people all over
*Food = SUCKS...really, they truly suck
*Service = slow
