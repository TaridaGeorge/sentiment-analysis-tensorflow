Terrible. 

This spot was going to be the kind of spot I could get quick dinner on a hectic weeknight with my Family. Not So! The Calamari was extremely tough and did not taste fresh. The pizza was just bad. It did not have layers of texture or taste in any way. Just black bottomed and crisp. Not burnt, but a strong sour burnt taste. The center was underdone and very soggy. Just a bad meal. This was my first time eating in, second time actually eating the Pizza. Both pizza's were a TERRIBLE let down.
