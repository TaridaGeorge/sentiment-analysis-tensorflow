Around Thanksgiving, we went to Mint Thai for lunch (it being our usual thai lunch spot). What a mess. The food wasn't tasty when it arrived - and it had taken forever to get the attention of the waitress for anything. In the end, out of a party of 4, only 1 of us had received what we ordered, 1 of us was violently ill (and remained so for DAYS - having to visit the doctor, etc), 2 of us felt moderately ill later, and only one of us felt ok. Such a disappointment.
