Not hot. Not even warm. Stone cold, kinda hard, not very fresh tasting. Hella sweet. Unsatisfying. 

Seriously, they are damaging their "brand" by opening this type of store. There is no difference between the Roosevelt store and picking up a box at the Circle K. What's next, a Little Debbie store front with a drive through?

I needlessly feared that this location would spell a serious loss of business for our nearby Rainbow Donuts. I now appreciate them even more by comparison to Krispy Kreme.
