If you like all your food sweet, this is your joint. I went with a group of three. The other two really liked their food, I did not. To my palette, all the dishes were overly sweet and terribly bland. I prefer more savory fare in the mix. And, call me crazy, I like to be able to distinguish individual flavors. The food was inexpensive, but that's all it had going for it.
