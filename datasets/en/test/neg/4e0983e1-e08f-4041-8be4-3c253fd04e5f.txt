Not so much a church as a HUGE THEATER.  The few "services" I have been to have always followed the same basic style:  SINGING, More Singing, a very long sermon, more singing, a collection, a baptism or two, more singing, and an altar call.  It all seemed so well rehearsed.  Maybe it's because I was brought up in a Catholic environment, but I found the size not very conductive to effective worship.  No one really gets to know anyone.  This "church" is not for me.
