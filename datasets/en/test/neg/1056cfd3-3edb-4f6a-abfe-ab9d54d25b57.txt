I used to be a huge fan of this place until last night. I went in to find a nice dress to wear. After wandering the store looking for the plus size section (I proudly wear a size 18) and not finding anything, I asked the clerk where it was. Apparently they no longer carry anything over a size 16.
Talk about being disappointed. I was so upset I almost cried. 
Shame on you...... You should also put a sign up now so that girls like me don't waste our time wondering through your store anymore...
