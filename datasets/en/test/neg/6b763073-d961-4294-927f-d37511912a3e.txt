I was also screwed by their deceptive pricing on gas. I have actually filed a complaint with the department of weights and measures (azdwm.gov). State law says that the price on the street sign MUST match the price on the dispenser. The street sign said $2.69 but the dispenser read $2.79. I guess I should be used to getting raped in Scottsdale, but for some reason it still hurts when it happens.
