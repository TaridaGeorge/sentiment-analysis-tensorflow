They told my friend it would only take 2 days repair, after six and phone call. He decided to go to the store to see if the repairs were completed. We got to the store at 7:50 the sign on the door said says they close at 8 o'clock

However they already had the door locked and were in the precess of closing. At first they did not seem  to not want help us or let him pick up his laptop. 

They finally came to they door and he was able to pick up his laptop. However as we were leaving my friend realized that there were some screws missing that held DVD driver in place.

This place is a joke
