Servers was rude and snotty; she rudely corrected the customer behind me when she called an item by the incorrect name and muttered other insults under breath thinking no one could hear. She was the only employee serving and cashiering and there was only one cook at 11:30 for the lunch rush? Some other employee spent her time walking back and forth ignoring the cook, the server and the line of customers. Skip this joint altogether! There is a Pei Wei at Grayhawk and another Panda at Desert Ridge.
