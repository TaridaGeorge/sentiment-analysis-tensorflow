I DREAD coming to this Victoria's Secret. I swear 90% of the time, they're on their period. 

Lets just say that their sales skills aren't as great as the one in Scottsdale (Fashion Square and Quarter)... instead, lets just say that it seems like their customer service skills came from SoCal. Yes, I went there. 

And right now, their Pink underwear is having a sale. I walked out empty handed because there were barely any underwear in stock...all fugly and it seems like a majority of the beezies out there are mediums, too. Ugh.
