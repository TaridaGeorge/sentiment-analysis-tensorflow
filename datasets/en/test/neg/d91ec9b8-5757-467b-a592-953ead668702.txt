The food was subpar. Although most of the staff was pleasant, I had the displeasure of spending time with the owner and her... um... boyfriend? They sucked all of the fun out of the environment.  I had a very unpleasant experience at this establishment.

For a place that advertises it's self as a sports bar, they sure don't have very many TVs in places that you can actually see them unless you're sitting at their bar. And the bar isn't very big!  

Do you self a favor and drive a few minutes down the road to Connolly's.
