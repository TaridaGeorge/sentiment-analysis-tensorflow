I went here for a while and although the teachers are excellent (Patrick and Loretta, especially) I ultimately quit because the owner, Marilyn, is totally rude. She does not know how to talk to people and has a really bad attitude. I had something really personal happen to me two days before the annual recital and all Marilyn could ask me was if I planned on being in and coming to the rehearsal and recital. Gee, where's the compassion? I had only lost my baby.
