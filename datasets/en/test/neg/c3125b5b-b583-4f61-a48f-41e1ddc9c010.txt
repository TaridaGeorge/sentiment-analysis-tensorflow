After several occassions of enjoying expensive wine on their patio, we were asked to leave after objecting to the blond Matre d's ecouragagement of smoking by females outside the restaurant doors. His attempt at flirting was more important to him than keeping customers and unfortunately we have many other fabulous options in the Kierland area for enjoying  dinner and wine.
