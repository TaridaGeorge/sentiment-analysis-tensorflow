Let me start off by saying, I had the worst service I have ever had in my life at the Barrio! Our server was SO rude! I went here with a friend of mine and we were completely blown away by our experience. This was my first time dining at Barrio Cafe and my very last! We ordered the table side guacamole, and it wasn't "table side," our server made it in back and just threw it down on the table. I ordered the fish taco's and my friend ordered the quesadilla . My fish tacos tasted like I was eating fish sticks wrapped in a stale tortilla. SO GROSS. My friends Quesadilla  was so bland, how do you mess up a quesadilla????  So to say the least Barrio Cafe is forever marked off my places to dine at in the city.
