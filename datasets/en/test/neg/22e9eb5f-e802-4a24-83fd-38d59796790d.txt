This hotel has the laziest employees.  Yesterday, I spilled espresso on my jacket while I was at the client across the street, I went  straight to the hotel front desk to drop off my jacket for dry cleaning.  I was promised that it will be picked up and returned the following day.  So today, I stopped by the front desk to pick up my jacket and I was so surprised to see that it was never sent out for dry cleaning and I asked the front desk person for an explanation, but she was just so full of excuses.

So, with that said, I will not be staying at this hotel if ever I am back to visit this client site in the future.
