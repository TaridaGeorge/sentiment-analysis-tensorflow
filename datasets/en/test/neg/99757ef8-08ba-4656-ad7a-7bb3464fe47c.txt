Not anymore.

20 minutes to check out, as only the self-checkouts were open and available.  5 people cruising around in front of the closed "person-operated" registers but no manned register opened for over 15 minutes.   25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self-checkout?

WTF?  

It's Sunday evening, too many people in line and whomever is in charge does not have someone open a register?

By the time I got to the self-checkout, the ice cream I came to get was pretty much a waste.  I paid for milk, OJ and broccoli, but left the ice cream.

While you are the closest to home, you are CERTAINLY not the best.  You have lost my business.
