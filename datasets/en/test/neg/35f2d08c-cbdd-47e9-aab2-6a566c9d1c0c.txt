Completely. Totally. Utterly - UN-impressed. 

I am not going to bother to nit-pick my lame experience through 5 'courses' (yes, 1 of them on a tiny spoon - maybe we took Thumbelina's table).  

Salad: "OK"
Steak: CHEWY (spat out several pieces - gross, i know)
(with hash browns for DINNER?!?!)

sourdough bread served with olive Oil (!?!) combined taste = acidic
smurf blue cotton candy  (WTH?!?!)

1 star for a yummy dessert - but by then i was pissed off, so it only counts to actually write and insert this reveiw!

ended up a pissy nite with us blaming each other who's stupid idea it was to choice to waste our nite (and MOOLA !!) here.
