One thing that I love about OSF is that they offer gluten-free pasta for those of us who have wheat/gluten issues. The one thing that I hate about OSF is that you never know if they will actually have the gluten-free pasta in stock. Usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta, which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering. This time we placed our order, received our drinks, ate our dinner salads, and then (a full 30 minutes after we placed the order) the server informed me that they were out of gluten-free pasta. Apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order. So not cool. We just paid for our drinks and left.
