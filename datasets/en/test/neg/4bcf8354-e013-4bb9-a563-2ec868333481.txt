i simply wanted to order 1 blouse when i was at the store on sunday, august 26th.  they must have kept me at the register for 40 minutes.  no one in the store could figure out how to order a blouse on-line.  i will never ver order at this store again !!!!!

the manager didn't even know how to order !!!!!!!!  i was given no discount.  no reduction.  nothing !!!!!!!

does anybody train the personnel ?  what a waste of my time !
