What a disappointment! $$ is false advertising. $38.00 for one pizza to go, that was half the weight of the normal pizza's we usually order from Spinato's and Rosati's. The meat was poor quality, ordered both sausage and pepperoni. Dry, sinewy and just plain awful!!! The onions were raw and too big. They charged $4. extra for artichokes and $4. extra for red peppers and the pepper slices were 1/4 thick and 1" long, there were about 4 bits on the whole pizza of all the extras we ordered for the 18" pizza. I would have preferred an AJ's or even a Bashas pizza than this Rip-Off. No wonder the place is dead. Save your money.
