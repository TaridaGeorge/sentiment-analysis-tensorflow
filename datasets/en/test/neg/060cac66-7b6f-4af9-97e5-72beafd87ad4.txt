The food is not good. I prefer a more traditional Thai restaurant with more authentic Thai food cooked by a Thai chef instead of a Hispanic Thai chef. If you are not used to authentic Thai food then you may be ok eating here. The yellow curry had no flavor and the poritons were really small and overpriced. The only reason I went to SaBai was becasue my usual authentic delicous Thai restaurant is closed on Sundays. This was not worth the $$$$$.
Would not recommend eating here.
