I'm giving one star for store cleanliness, that's it. This store always lacks knowledgeable employees... and employees in general for that matter.  This store is like a ghost town, it's usually wierd walking in because it is always empty. If it's an absolute emergency and I need a part or product and don't need to rely on any other opinion before purchasing, then I might give them my business because they are so close. Otherwise, I usually just drive the extra few miles to Home Depot. There is a reason Home Depot pulls in 20 billion more in annual revenue per year.
