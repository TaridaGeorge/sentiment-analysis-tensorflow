The only reason it even gets one star is because the employees were pleasant.  Other than that I will never go back to this theater.  The amount of trash outside was appalling.  Probably due to all the kids hanging outside.  The movie experience was so bad that we will never come back here, or maybe any other theater.  The barrage of cell phone texting and people talking to each other loudly like they're in their own living room was unacceptable.  The stress and annoyance of this outweighed any pleasure of trying to watch the film.   From now on I'll just wait the few months until the movie comes on out DVD.
