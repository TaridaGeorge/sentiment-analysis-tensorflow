I was appalled at the way this company does business.  The owner is unprofessional and blatantly rude. My brother paid them $150 for a gift certificate for me for the gourmet cooking class with wine.  Shortly after I found out I was pregnant.  I called them while it was valid to see if I could use it after I gave birth.  They said yes but I couldn't reschedule once the appointment was made.  When I went to make the appointment they now won't honor it.  They take $150 and give no service - what a scam!!!!  Oh and the owner hung up on me when I said that it isn't right that she take money and not give service or honor her word.  Also, see the other reviews on Google, there are other similar instances with this company.  Terrible!
