Snottiest, most arrogant office I have ever been to.  After waiting 90 minutes past our appointment time, without so much as an "I'm sorry we are running late" or "would you like a glass of water?",  some snotty woman comes out and lectures us about how special his excellency is and how we should all be good little boys and girls.   

Find another office!!!!
