Wow how can you screw up pizza? This place did. Soggy and flavorless and we got attitude from the manager (owner?) when one of crew asked for a fork and knife. There was no way you could pick up the pizza to eat it! Service was slow, yes there were ten of us, but it was lunchtime and it's slices!  How hard can that be to reheat and serve them up?! Lame place they get one star for the air conditioning. Brooklyn attitude with Dominos Pizza quality.
