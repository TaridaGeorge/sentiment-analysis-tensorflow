I've passed by this place and really wanted to try it. I finally stopped in and was very disappointed with my experience. The food was portion was tiny and the price was ridiculous. I'm a big advocate of getting what you pay for however for the 20 bucks we spent it, was just an appetizer. The steak burger was tiny and it cost extra for every little topping. It Ended up being a 6 dollar McDonalds mcdouble. Very disappointed. The Mac and cheese bites were very disappointing  for the price as well.  We ordered fried mushrooms and never received them due to human error when taking the order which is understandable. People do make mistakes  however since we were so disappointed with everything else we felt it wasn't worth our money to try them. Overall not a place I will be coming back to.
