Sprout's bought out Sunflower a while back but just started hauling out their stuff into Sunflower location instead of maintaining the brand.

A lot of the alterna-friendly staff is gone and Sprout's corporate staff that are swarming the store to 'renovate' it have left a bunch of stock in cooler shelves to rot (some stuff expired days ago, BARF). 

Sunflower store brand things are being replaced with Sprout's stuff that is not as friendly to vegan, vegetarian or soy-free diets. ex, The Sprout's "gelato" has a ton of natural and artificial thickeners and other crap and is still being sold for as high of a price as the actual gelato and natural ice creams being phased out of inventory.

Here's to hoping that the produce stays as fresh as Sunflower used to carry, since having cheapskate produce managers fluffing past date/wilted produce was the reason I vehemently avoided Sprout's.
