My husband and I are fairly well versed in sushi restaurants.  This place is WAY overpriced and the food is subpar at best. They don't have a kids menu and they refused to make just a bowl of noodles for our 3 year old.  It took forever for service and then forever for our food.  The best tasting thing was the miso soup, bulgogi was bland, sushi was bland, calamari was overfried and just not good.  Service wasn't great either.  So overall we just spent $40 on a bland dinner and won't be coming back.  Sorely disappointed.
