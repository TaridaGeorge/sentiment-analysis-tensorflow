While the customer service was ok, the place was noisy when I first walked in with other customers talking really loudly.  THAT was really annoying coming from someone from New York!  The presentation of the take-out food was certainly NOT appealing! It was greasy, and had everything but the kitchen sink mixed in with my fried rice! Definitely was not tasty.  I do NOT recommend this place to anyone...
