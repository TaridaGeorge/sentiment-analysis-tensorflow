I have been refused  service for no apparent reason...I have had this place deliver to my home before and not EVER had any problems as WENDY & RAYMOND have stated.  They are willing to lose business over something that they cannot or refuse to explain to me.  In this day of our economy, I cannot believe that ANYONE, especially a small chinese food establishment, would refuse business!!!  Staff was extremely rude and no manager was available, how convenient!!!  The food is not worth the hassle.  I hope the economy takes them down!!!   Would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE!!!  I wouldn't even give them (1) star if I had the option of (0)!!!  Poor customer service !!!
