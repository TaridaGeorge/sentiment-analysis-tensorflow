Why does this place get business? There are only guy bartenders and they are all dooshbags. The drinks are weak and extremely overpriced. You have to walk through the minorities dancing to get to the bar, and when you get there you are constantly bumped into by DABS. The DJ is ok, but Robbies and Canteen have better ones. This bar was cool back in the day, but now it sucks and I don't miss all the annoyances I experience when Im there.
