This place can eat my ass!! I went to the deli to get a sandwhich. 

So I asked the clerk if they used any partially hydrogenated oils.

She had to call her corporate office.

They called her back to tell her the verdict...........................

(..........................= drumroll)

Bingo!  The harmfull oil is in there wheat bread and the white bread!!!

AMAZING!! I could never support a supposed health food store that uses an oil like that. 

If you dont know how bad it is. peep this out
