My best test for any restaurant is the carry out order to see if the business' employees are really paying attention to their patrons. With that being said, I say buyer beware to anyone dining here. I placed my order for chicken tikka Marsala along with 2 garlic naans. I didn't get what I had ordered. If it wasn't an hour's drive back, I would have returned the food.
