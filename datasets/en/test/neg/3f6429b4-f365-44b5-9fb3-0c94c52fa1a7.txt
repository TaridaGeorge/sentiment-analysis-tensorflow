So I started a yelp account for the sole reason to warn people looking for sushi. It's 12:18 In the after noon, I ate there at 9pm. I was woken at 2am, 4am, and all day today been disturbed by the most foul stomach problems I've ever encountered, as with my gf. This place by far has the WORST quality sushi I've ever endured, I don't care how cheap their drinks are, this place blows. **warning** only eat at the place if you need a legitmate reason to get a doctors note to dip o class the next day**
