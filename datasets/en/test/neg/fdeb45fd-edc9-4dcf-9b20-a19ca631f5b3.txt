I kept giving this place a chance to prove itself since the reviews I read on Yelp tend to be positive, last night I gave up. Pricey Italian food, with quality lower than what I usually get at other Italian restaurants. The linguine with clams has no sweetness of seafood, but saltiness. The grits of sand in the dish made chewing a noisy and lousy experience. When I talked to the waitress casually about it, she was immediately defensive. Instead of acknowledging the problem she simply told me its inevitable. She also brought us the check without offering desert menu. I will never visit again.
