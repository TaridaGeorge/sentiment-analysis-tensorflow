I had just got of work and it was pouring rain and my ride bailed on me. I went into YoLove for cover from the rain while I called around to find a ride. I was in tears, wet, and frustrated. Someone came up to me, saw me crying, and then kicked me out. I couldn't even believe it. It was storming so hard traffic lights had gone out and trees were fallen on the street. 

Seriously, I will never buy from these assholes ever. I don't care how good their yogurt is. Who kicks a young crying girl out in the rain at night? Fuck you guys.
