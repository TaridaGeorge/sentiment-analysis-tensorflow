Been there a couple of times. Would not recommend it.
Went there first for lunch with a group. Buffet was not great. Actually below average. Customer service WORST! They couldnt split the check equally among people who had given credit cards and cash. They took all the cash and split the rest on credit.
BAD!!!
The next time, it was dinner. Not that great of a food esp for the price. The vegetable fritters tasted like they were fried for the second time. Tasted burnt too!
NOT going there again.
