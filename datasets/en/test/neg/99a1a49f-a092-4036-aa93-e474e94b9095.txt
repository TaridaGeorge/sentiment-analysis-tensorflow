The worst public golf I've ever experienced in the many years I've been golfing with friends. We were approached on the 2nd hole on a Saturday morning and told that we had to play ready-ball!! It wasn't that busy so no need at all to be interrupted and hassled on several holes. The only reason my game got slowed down was because this Steve guy was watching us (distracting us) on every hole and asking for our receipts twice! Steve later on apologized, but when I told him I wanted a refund he never did anything . We had to skip the putting portion on several holes to get him off out backs. I didn't get what I paid for.
