Stayed here once in 2006 and had roaches in the room.  Now in October of 2010 my husbands company had an incentive trip.  6 people so far have been hit with credit card fraud!  The highest victim got hit for a 1200.00 purchase on the same card used to check in.  Stay away or monitor your credit after staying here!!!!!!!
