Tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien. Nothing great. Service was also not good. Although I did go just before it closes. Even then I asked if you guys are still serving and would have been more than satisfied if they denied service. Looking at all the reviews. I might just try it again. But for now.... NOT Satisfied.
