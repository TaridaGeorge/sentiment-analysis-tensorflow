I was in Scottsdale for 2 weeks a couple months ago for training and came here for happy hour only once. The girls that work here are cute but have horrible attitudes, the sushi presentation is awesome but the flavor and freshness is seriously lacking. The bathrooms were filthy, one of the urinals was broken and covered with a black trash bag and there was piss all over the floor. I came here with a group from training and it was so loud we couldn't hear each other unless we yelled. We all agreed this is one of the worst sushi places we have been to.

-Over the two weeks I was in Scottsdale I ended up going to Stingray Sushi about 5 times because the girls are prettier, the service is better, and the sushi options and freshness is way better.
