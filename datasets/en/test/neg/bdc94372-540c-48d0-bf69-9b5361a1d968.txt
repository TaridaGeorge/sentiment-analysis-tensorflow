Went here on the way back to work on my lunch break, never been here before and was starving. Unsure of what to order, I decided on the steak salad. For one, this is a greek place and they dont have pepperocini? dissappointed. Got my salad and the dressing was just gross. tasted like oil and vinegar and thats it. The tzaziki sauce was the least favorite of all that I have tried. The salad was just tasteless, had bell peppers tomato and cucumber on it for veggies, thats it. The steak was good but that was the only good part of the meal. The lettuce was just like iceberg lettuce chopped up absolutely no variety. Will never go here again.
