I just gave this place their second chance and they completely blew it. A disgrace.
I order the drunken fried rice. It was tasteless and simply the worst fried rice I ever had. And the dinner portion is much less than the lunch portion at any thai restaurant I have been to. 

The first time I went there I got the pad thai and it was just as awful: tasteless and simply the worst pad thai I ever had. 

If you are a fan of thai fried rice, pad thai, or just want to have a filling meal, stay away from this place. It's horrendous.
