My friends and I went to this place for a Sunday buffet.  The food was tasty and place was clean. But, like all Indian food, i judge the food on how i feel later in the day or day after. I felt there was a stone in my stomach. Had so much trouble and had a bad stomach upset. So did  my friends. This place seems to add too much basking soda in the food.  Would recommend against it. Won't go there either.
