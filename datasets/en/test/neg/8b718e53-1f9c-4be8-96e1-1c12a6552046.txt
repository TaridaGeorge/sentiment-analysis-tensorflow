Disappointing. Food overpriced for quality and cook refused to make egg white omelette. 
The place appears to be converted from another run down store and the renovation did not include the booths.  As someone sat behind me, the back of my booth bent forward. 
Pass on this place and hit up Filiberto's right next door.  Better quality food for a better price.
