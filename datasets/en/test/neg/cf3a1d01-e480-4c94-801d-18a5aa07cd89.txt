We used to go this restaurant over two years ago and usually 2 to 3 times per week.  The service at dinner time is bad, bad, bad.  Poor management and only one waiter or waitress.  We try to go back once or twice a year, hoping it gets better.  I enjoy the food and it is in the neighborhood.  I can understand why they don't pack them in anymore.  Seems like corporate would look at these reviews and make sure the service is brought up to par!  Won't be returning for at least 2 more years.  And that is probably only a MAYBE!!!!
