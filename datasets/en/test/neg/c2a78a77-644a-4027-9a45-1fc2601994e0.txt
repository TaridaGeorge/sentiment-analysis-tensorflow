Here's a dissss-gusting one for you.  Picture this.... 1993, Highschool, floating down the Salt River with a light buzz (who doesn't drink on the river?  Even 7 year olds are plastered) and my friend asks me what happend to my leg?  Why the bandaid?  I thought that was strange... nothing happened to my leg, I didn't have on a bandaid.  But I did.... it wasn't mine, it must have been in the water and it stuck to side of my leg with my ass firmly planted in the tube and my gams dangling in the water.  UGHHHHHH... I almost threw up, but instead I drank another warm keystone light and made it all better. 

Never again.
