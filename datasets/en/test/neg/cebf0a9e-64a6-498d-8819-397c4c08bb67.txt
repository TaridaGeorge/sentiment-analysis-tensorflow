I bought my car from Berge Mazda two years ago, but quickly stopped taking it in for service there.  They charged about $60 for my car's inspection (which pretty much amounted to nothing more than a traditional oil change, fluid topping, and tire rotation).  Then they showed me that there was something lodged in my tire.  They said it was too big to repair and wanted $150 to replace the single tire.  After having a good laugh, I took my car to a Discount Tire Co. and they repaired the damage for free.  It turned out the thing lodged in my tire was a drill bit.
