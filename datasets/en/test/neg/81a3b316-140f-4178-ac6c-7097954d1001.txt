The food is OK, not great. The Mongolian beef is maybe the only great thing they have, everything else is mediocre. I order it because there aren't many other options in my area and I keep hoping they'll do better.

I am especially disappointed in their delivery times. When I order, they quote me 30-45 minutes, AN HOUR LATER (sometimes MORE)  it finally arrives... COLD. This has happened the last two times I ordered from this place. The food is already bland, then to deliver it cold? AND they don't even apologize. 

QWIK Chinese? Ya right. Not even close to "qwick".
