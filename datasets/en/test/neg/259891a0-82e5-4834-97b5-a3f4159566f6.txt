I posted a review here almost a year ago, and since then the Native New Yorker is no longer in business at this location. All I can say is good riddance! I knew they would'nt be around for very long. This was the trashiest sportsbar around except for maybe Teakwoods which was about a block away from this place, and they are no longer around also. Glad to see both these places gone forever!  My favorites are Tavern Grill, and Goldies.
