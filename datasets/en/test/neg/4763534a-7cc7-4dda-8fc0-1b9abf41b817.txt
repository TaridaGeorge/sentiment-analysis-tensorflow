Absolutely beware of the parking. I paid huge dollars for Wicked tickets months ago.  The performance is next week. I received an email TODAY that no ASU parking is available as school is in session. The closest parking is on 5th and Maple.  This should be disclosed at time of ticket purchase so an informed decision can be made.
