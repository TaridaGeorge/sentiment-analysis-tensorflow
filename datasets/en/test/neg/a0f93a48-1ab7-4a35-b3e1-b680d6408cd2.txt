Awful.  Pizza was disgusting (we ordered the thin crust.)  I've had better frozen pizza.  In fact, this might have been the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of having.  I can't imagine why people rave about this place, or why they actually wait for it.  I came here expecting the pizza to be amazing.  It was, just not in a positive way.  Never again.  What a mistake.
