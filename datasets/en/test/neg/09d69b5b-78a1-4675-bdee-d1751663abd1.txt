Sales dept. is ok service dept. is lacking in integrity. Long story short. Had oil change and was informed that my low mileage Kia sedona was in immediate need of rear brake disc pads since they were down to 2mm. Told service adviser I doubted that work was needed . He became adamant that had to be done right now. Took to Sands kia for service and on the inspection worksheet they noted that my rear brake pads were now at 6mm. You be the judge.
