I have been going there for 16 years since moving to the valley and was extremly disapointed with the last visit I ordered an eggplant sub and the eggplant was hard as a rock advised  the waiter who was very polite and brought the order back the next time the eggplant was just as hard and this time cold  I ad vised the cook behind the counter  who rudely told the women behind the counter to return my money and did not even apoligize or offer me something else this does not seem like a way to obtain repeat business. john m
