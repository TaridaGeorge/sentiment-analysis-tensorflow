It's hard to review food when the cleaning chemicals are so strong you can't eat.  The section I was seated in was being cleaned with strong disinfectant, I was asked to move my feet so they could clean the floor under my table but they swabbed my feet too!!!  I was here for food, not a shoe swabbing.

Well, I got sick from the disinfectant, paid for my food and left.  Yep, they make you too sick to eat, then charge you for food that hasn't been delivered!!!

So I can't comment on the food, but the cleaning products stunk and left stains on my shoes.   Not really the experience I was looking for.
