The customer service here is AWFUL!  The manager is less than nice, even at the best of times. 
I was at Zipps recently for several college ball games, where thank goodness Megan our server was amazing, because the rest of the service was horrible.
Not only was I in attendance for bad behavior on management's part, but also able to read an atrocious letter written to a friend simply because she wrote a bad review.
I will NEVER be stepping foot in Zipps again, and will be forwarding the letter to ALL my friends. 
The food isnt that great, and the beer is cheaper is most other establishments, where management is generally nicer. 
I only wish I could give ZERO STARS!
