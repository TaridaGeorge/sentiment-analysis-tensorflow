Couldn't get what we wanted here!   A basic cell phone at a low price.  

Needed a replacement for a damaged phone.  By the way, we are long time customers.

The Verizon store only carries a few models.  Our salesman said that 'basic phones' are dinosaurs.  They are being replaced by smart phones.  Suggested we go to Verizon online store and maybe purchase a basic phone there. Once the phone is delivered we can go back to the store for activation.  In other words no replacement and activation in one trip.

We, the dinosaurs, proceeded out the door.  Back home to the computer for some do it yourself time.  I call the whole Verizon experience Customer Disservice.
