This place was highly suggested; however, when Shane and I showed up the only thing that looked good about this place was an oceanic painting on the wall.  I give this place a one star because the food was hot and ready in like 5 minutes, but the appearance was interesting.  I ordered orange chicken; you can't really mess up orange chicken rite?  Well the supposed fried rice was just white rice drenched in soy sauce and the noodles looked old and gross.  The orange chicken tasted nothing like orange and it looked like it was previously frozen.  Sorry peeps I will not be going back to the Golden China.  PS not sure why they are called "Golden" China as there was nothing golden about this place.
