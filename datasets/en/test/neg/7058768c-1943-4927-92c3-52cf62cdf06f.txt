I didn't dine in the place but I did get delivery . For the most part I am not a fan of freaky weird pizzas and I prefer them traditionalism you might think different . 

We ordered two basic pizzas to share....and both of us didn't like the crust...weird tasting sweet wheat.... 


both of us didn't like the sauce....like ketchup . 

I note the cheese was actually good but this variation of pizza is not for pizza lovers
