Encountered the rudest and most unprofessional employee here at this venue EVER...what tha f*** ???

Not even the nice ones could make up for it.  We had great seats, right behind Home team Dugout.  Even the fellow fans in the seats around us were great....but this one employee was so completely off the chart lame, I'm going to fault this whole establishment for her suckiness.
