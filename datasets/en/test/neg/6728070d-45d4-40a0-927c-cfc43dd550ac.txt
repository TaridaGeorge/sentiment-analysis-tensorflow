Went to San Felipe, Desert ridge on 6/19/09.  Got there about 9pm. Staff was almost nonexistence with a 3rd grade mentality, not really busy, ordered dinner and drinks. Taco Bell would have been better, including the service. At 10pm we where asked to leave because we had a 11 year old with us and that policy would not allow him to be there. It was never written, spoken or mentioned to us during the short stay that he could not be there after 10pm. Will not go back. Ever!!!
