Terrible haunted attraction. Waited in line for 2 hours to get in, then there were only 5 scenes in the corn maze. There were hardly any actors, we just walked through corn with nothing jumping out at us. The very first scene we came to the actor was talking to another actor then he saw us and made a very sad attempt to scare us. It didn't work!  I would defintely not recommend this place. The corn mazes at Fear Farm were much better.
