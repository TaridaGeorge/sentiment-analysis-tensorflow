Not the best, not the worst (that's USAir), but I definitely see they're allowing many free upgrades.  I'm a Premier member and fly regularly - haven't had the advertized free upgrade in 12 flights.  

Rates nearly doubled too.

Got burned when booking on UNITED's website that had a "STAR Alliance Partner" flight from USAir.  I arrived only to be charged $25 per check-in bag (Premier members are supposed to be free) and not upgraded to Economy Plus.

Thanks UNITED, I'm not feeling your love of my loyalty...
