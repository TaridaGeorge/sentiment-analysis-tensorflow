No fresh fruit.. no mochi.. not Pinkberry! 

It's pretty unfair to compare every fro-yo joint to Red Mango or Pinkberry but for me these places have set a certain standard that every fro-yo place for me has to live up to.. Golden Spoon, no exception.. I would compare the taste of the fro-yo here to that of what you get at some convenience stores.. now granted I only had the vanilla with yogurt chips and Ive been told that the chocolate is better, but if you cant do vanilla right, well.. what's the point? It also wouldn't be hard for them to add fresh fruit, come on, really?!

I can't wait till Pinkberry opens a location(s) here!
