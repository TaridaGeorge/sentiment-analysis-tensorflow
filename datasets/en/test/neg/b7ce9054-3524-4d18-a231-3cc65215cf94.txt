RUN RUN RUN as fast as you can from this girl!!  "Hue Goddess"??? What a complete joke.  $90 for color that lasts 2 weeks at best.  I have thick hair so we put a straightening solution on the back and it  was great until next haircut when she literally CHOPPED all my hair off in the back.  Again, $80 down the drain.  Her solution for fixing the color is to pawn you off on another inept stylist.  One star is too much.
