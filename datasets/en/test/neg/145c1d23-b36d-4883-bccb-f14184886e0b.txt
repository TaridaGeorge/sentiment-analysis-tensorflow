CLOSED. I wanted to try this place. I planned and look forward to it all week. I arrived at the place to find the sign ripped down but the stuff still inside. The landlord here must be a real peach. Everything I love in this shopping center leaves. Property is always Being locked away. Next pay period I guess I'll try Chandler. I love Arizona. *gag*
