Go here if you want to smell like your greasy meal afterwards for three days!!! Don't dare wear a cute little outfit because you'll smell like sausage, deep fry grease, and stale coffee forever. The aroma infuses into the fibers of your clothes! I had to take a shower immediately after because my hair smelled like so much grease. 

I took my jacket off and left my room and came back to the whole hotel room smelling like Waffle House, but not in a good maple syrup warmth way.
