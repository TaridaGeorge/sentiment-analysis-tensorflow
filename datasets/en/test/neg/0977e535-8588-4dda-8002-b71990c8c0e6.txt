If I could give it a negative star I would! Fried wontons stale & awful, Kung Pao chicken was so dry it was not worth eating, sun devil pork was stringy & filled with gristle! Awful! We didn't even eat any, told the waitress how awful it was & she did nothing. Had coupon for free dinner b1g1 & they refused to take it! Do yourself a favor don't go!
