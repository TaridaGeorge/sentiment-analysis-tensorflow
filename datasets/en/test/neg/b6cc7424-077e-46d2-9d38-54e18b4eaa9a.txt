I got the #9 giant and I feel that I was ripped off because they sliced my meat & cheese so thin you can see through it. I couldn't even taste the meat & cheese at all.  It was like having a lettuce, tomato and bread sandwich.  The tomatoes weren't fresh either, they were mushy. Also, the workers are dirty when it comes to handling your food.   I saw too many times the workers are handling the money with their gloves on and not changing them before they handle your food.  I travel for business all over the U.S. and this Jersey Mike's is far the worst! Where is the owner when all of this is going on? They are letting teenagers with their bad food handling practices run their sandwich shop into the ground. I will not recommend this Jersey Mikes to anyone. I want my $14.00 back!
