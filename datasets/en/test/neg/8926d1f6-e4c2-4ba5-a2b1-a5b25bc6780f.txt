OK, the reason why I am only giving it one star is because I know they closed and the signs says that Morning Squeeze is coming soon. However, I work VERY close to that place and haven't seen any activity other than the owners going in and out of the place a couple of times since it closed. The tables are still outside on the Patio, but the chairs are gone. I wondered what really happened? One of the guys that seemed to be associated  with JW's opened the Burger joint where the Philadelphia Sandwich Co. used to be. Well, if they are going to do something there, do it soon. Let's see if they can give The Breakfast Club a run for their money.
