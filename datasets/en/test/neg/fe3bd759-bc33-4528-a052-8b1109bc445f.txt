I will just say that when you find a good Sushi place, stick too it! I am not a big fan of trying new places when you already have been somewhere amazing! I will also not return, the best thing I had was the deep-fried crunchy eel roll....when they can't get a spicy tuna roll right...it can't be good!
If you are looking for an amazing place, and are in the north scottsdale area, check out Fusion Sushi: http://www.yelp.com/biz/fusion-sushi-and-china-bistro-scottsdale
