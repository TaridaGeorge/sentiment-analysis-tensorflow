I checked in here today and saw they had a coupon upon check in. So I bought stuff and tried to pay for it and use the coupon. The guy that checked us out said the coupon was bogus and that sports authority never put the coupon on. He said that yelp put the coupon on the website without sports authority knowing. Seriously? Crappy service and staff that clearly don't know how to honor their own company coupons.
