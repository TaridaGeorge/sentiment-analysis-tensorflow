Decided to give it a 2nd chance after a terrible grand opening with long wait times for food and then not getting some of the food we ordered.

Well, 2nd time is even worse than the first!  Over an hour to get food after ordering and when the food came the wings were less then Native quality.  Beyond small, barely warm, and rubbery like they had been sitting.  Never saw a manager once or I would have let him/her know without sugar coating it this time how I just wasted $50.xx and listened to my kids gripe about being hungry for over an hour until the food came out.

There are much better options for wings where the service and food quality is not this poor.

- 1 Star just because at least my iced tea was decent!
