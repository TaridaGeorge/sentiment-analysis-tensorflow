I had one hour for lunch, and had heard this was one of the best places in town. I expected the lunch combo would come with a cup of soup - but not here, even though lunch is hi-priced. The weather was cold, so I wanted soup. I ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls. It took 45 minutes between the time I sat down and when I got my food! The soup was not sizzling, and had small round BURNT rice cakes floating in the cup. BURNT BLACK. I had ten minutes to eat and get back to the office, so I could not return my meal. I fished out the burnt pieces and ate quickly. Maybe this place had a good rep in the past, but I will never go back there!
