I took my two cats here and sadly, had to put one down. They were an okay establishment but nothing that screamed world class in my book. 

When my daughter came across a newborn cat on the sidewalk, I drove straight over to the vet where I had spent upwards of $2,000 on animal visits over the previous few years. 

Upon bringing in this day-old kitten with little knowledge of how to keep it alive, I was told by the office manager that they don't take animals in off the streets. They get paid by the county to take in animals. And with that, I was no longer a customer of Tri-City East. 

Family Vet Care of Mesa, however, won me over... read their review!!
