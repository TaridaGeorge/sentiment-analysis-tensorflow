Would have liked to eat here, but after it took 30 mins. for parking on a Thursday afternoon, we got there right at 3:00 and were turned away because it was "closed." Even though the buffet still looked open and people were there still serving themselves (i.e.: stuffing their faces), I was turned away and told to come back on another day. Based on this as my first impression, I will not return. I am wondering, then, if I had arrived just 5 minutes earlier, would I have been served? I guess this doesn't really matter considering I won't return another time, as the manager so glibly suggested.
