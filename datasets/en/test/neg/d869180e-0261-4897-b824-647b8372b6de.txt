I am a Phoenix native and I had never made it to the Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast.  The setting is lovely, and after being served breakfast, I realized that the atmosphere was the only aspect of this restaurant I had ever heard reviewed.  The weak coffee, pedestrian food and awkward service don't deserve comment!  I wanted to like the Morning Glory Cafe, but lousy food served in a nice setting is not made gourmet by charging stunningly high prices for it.
