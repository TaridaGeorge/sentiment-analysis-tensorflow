Love Buffalo Wild wings, but not this location. Went there with my boyfriend and his friend and a server took us to our table and it took them 10-15 min to get someone  aka the manager over to our table to greet us and give us all water and get our drink order. I normally get the honey bbq wings and when they came out they had absloutely no sauce on them. never will go back here again, kinda disappointed cause its close to home.
