I tried to order to go from this place. The phone rang and rang and rang, when someone finally did pick up they put me on hold until the line disconnected. I called back and had the exact same thing happen. We figured they were just busy and decided to drive there to get to go. There was only ONE car in the parking lot. And the place looked like a total dump, like cockroaches in the kitchen dump. 

Forget this place. There is no excuse for not taking a phone order when there is no one in your restaurant.
