Wow. I thought PIZZAM was really subpar. So much that I wouldn't go back. I gave it one star for the service - the people working there were quite nice, and the process was quick, too. The food however - ew! We ordered 2 pizzas, salad and a meatball sandwich. The salad was really basic, dressing out of a bottle. We didnt care for the "crust" that was like cardboard, or the toppings - ie, the sausage tasted like what I might find on a frozen Tony's pizza!  I was really hopeful, as I live close enough to walk, but it just didnt work for us.  If you are in the area and really want pizza, try down the street at Picazzo's - much better food and atmosphere.
