Unbelievably bad. The Lo Mein was starchy and gummy, the chicken tasted like Mcnuggets, and the sauce tasted like oil, sugar, and salt-and nothing else. Mom's dish was just as bad. Her chicken was rock hard, her brown rice was over cooked AND old...and we arrived there only 20 minutes after they opened. Disgusting. The people are nice I guess, but if the food sucks, who cares ?
