Have you people not gone to a good pho place?  Hands down the worst vermicelli dish I ever had and my friend wasn't fond of his pho. The egg roll tasted of mushy grease, the pork lacked flavor. The rice paper for the spring roll was still dehydrated and crunchy in spots.  I'm not from Arizona so I'm not sure if this is the best your state has to offer, which is indicated from the rest of the reviews. I feel sorry and sad.
