This is the worst restaurant in the whole world.  The manager has no respect for his customers.  I couldn't believe what  he told my parents when they complained about the loud music and airconditioning.  He told them that he didn't care, and he doesn't need their business.  I can't believe someone managing in the food industry would talk to my 70 year old parents that way. Shame on them.
