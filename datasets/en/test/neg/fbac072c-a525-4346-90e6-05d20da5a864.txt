People that live out here in Glendale must have some pretty substandards. This place is horrible, the sliders are pathetic and compared to Chicago Hamburger on 40th and Indian School, these are total crap. Their fried zucchini was out of a frozen plastic bag, obviously not fresh. I don't like to trash a place after only one time going there but this place is awful. 

The inside of this place is depressing as hell too! Just a bunch of new hot dogs advertisement signs and ugly mcdonalds yellow and red walls. This place is an epic failure and should shut down and try again. Also I only had two sliders and a few zucchini sticks and I feel sick to my stomach, any other place I can handle about 4 sliders and a large side with no problem so that has to say something.
