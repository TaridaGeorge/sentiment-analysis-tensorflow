This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling. 

For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told "Too late" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints. 

Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told "No". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them. 

I will not buy anything from them again.
