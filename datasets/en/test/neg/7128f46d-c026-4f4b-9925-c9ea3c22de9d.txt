I agree with Andrew T.  When my wife and I walked in, right away we felt like we were disturbing the two female employees' social hour.  There was No, "Hi, welcome to Subway", better yet, no response and/or acknowledgement at all.  Last time I checked, customers at any business makes the paycheck.  Also, when we finally got service, we were quickly rushed, and ofcourse no "Thank you".  I only gave one star to the fact that nothing was wrong with our food, but really how can you mess that up when the customers are telling them what we want on our subs.
