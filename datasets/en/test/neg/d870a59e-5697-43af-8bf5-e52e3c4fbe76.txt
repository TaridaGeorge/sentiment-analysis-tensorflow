I don't understand the reviews of the restaurant.  Either we were on an off day or this restaurant won't last another 30 days.  The food quality, service, management attentiveness was absolutley non-existent.  Some of the dishes could have been good if they were served hot and on time.  Service was horrendously slow and several of the dishes were inedible.  The Sea Bass was extremely salty, the Moroccan Chicken was cold and the medium rare lamb chops were well done.  
We complained to the servers repeatedly and to the management with no positive results.  Management appears brain dead.  They had two responses: "We're sorry to hear that" and "We're utilizing a new concept" .
