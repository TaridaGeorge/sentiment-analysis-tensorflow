i have not been a huge fan of charlies for a while....for some reason it always smells like vomit....about 8 months ago my car was broken into they stole a purse out of the front floor board, the funny thing is they had police walking the parking lot...fast forward to now march 6th 2011 had another car broken into this time they stole a caboodle which had make up in it and a rhinestoned mask...when we went inside and asked them to call the police, they said they couldn't and gave us the number to do it ourselves. great customer service...i think not!!!  then we were out side and the bar manager came out and said they have video of the whole parking lot and we can get a copy of it great!!! oh but but we have to wait till thursday...now i hate the bar even more.
