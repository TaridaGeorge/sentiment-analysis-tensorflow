The service here was not attentive at all. I was sitting at the bar and when you wait for 6 min for a refill of water but you had to ask for a refill at that point is bad. Also when you order a BBQ burger that is supposed to have a garlic aioli on the burger, when it comes out without either of these items and the bartender try's to tell me that it's not supposed to be smothered. Not a hint of dressing or BBQ to be doing anywhere. It's not good when the staff argues with he customer telling him he is wrong for not knowing what a gourmet burger is. I guess I will be hitting up Delux next time instead of this. I would pass on this place.
