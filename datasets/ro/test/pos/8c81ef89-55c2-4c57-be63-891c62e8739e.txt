generally speaking, nu imi plac animatiile prea tare. i mean, trebuie sa am chef, like for real, sa vad o animatie, otherwise, i can't bare it. but anyway am avut un chef teribil azi de dimineata - like when i got up - to see something like this. i'm glad i picked up tangled. it was gorgeous.
nu este o "capodopera" dar i-am dat oricum 10 pentru ca mi-a placut foarte mult. are acel ceva foarte simpatic care face o animatie atat de entertaining and i didn't find anything unpleasant regarding this animated movie.
au fost o multime de faze amuzante and the graphic was sweet.
